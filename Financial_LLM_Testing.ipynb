The measure, called the chained consumer price index, would lower the annual payment increases for Social Security beneficiaries, saving the government money as it lowers the future monthly income of retirees and disabled Americans. The change would also raise revenue over time because it would cause more taxpayers to wind up in higher marginal brackets.What neither side seems to have noticed, however, is that the difference between the chained CPI and the standard CPI has been diminishing. That means the impact of switching indexes may not be as great as many assume. The change may still be a good idea, but it probably won\\'t matter as much as expected.\"\\n--Stocks and Unemployment: The Economist charts stock performance against the unemployment rate. \"The relationship between equity markets and unemployment is complex: since the early 1990s America\\'s unemployment rate has tended broadly to mirror the movements of the S&P 500 index of share prices. But this connection has been stretched of late. Since September 2009 share prices have risen 132%, whereas the unemployment rate, which peaked at 10% a month later, has fallen rather more slowly. And last week, as the S&P 500 hit an all-time high, unemployment was edging down as far as 7.6%. This is a sign of a decoupling between corporate profitability and labour-market strength, which reflects the increasingly globalised nature of America\\'s businesses and the boon to capital of pools of cheap labour (real average wages in America are 16% below their 1973 peak). After adjusting for inflation, the S&P 500 is still 25% below its March 2000 high, though shares remain 35% overvalued when measured against the cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio created by Robert Shiller, an economist. If cash-rich companies invest their hoards or return them to shareholders, who may also invest them, that could kick-start the real economy and hasten the decline in unemployment.\"\\n--Imports Mary Amiti and Amit Khandelwal ask whether import competition makes domestic goods better. \"Exposing domestic firms to foreign competition affects the quality of exports. Importantly, the effect of import competition on quality upgrading depends on the product\\'s quality relative to that of its competitors: Lower tariffs promote quality upgrading of products close to the world quality frontier but discourage quality upgrading for those far away from it. For these results to hold, a country must have a good business environment.\"\\nCompiled by Phil Izzo\\n'}\n"

       " Document(page_content='When President Barack Obama introduces his budget proposal Wednesday, one expected twist is adopting a new cost-of-living calculation. Instead of the traditional consumer price index, the budget would use the so-called chain-weighted CPI.\\nIt is a good idea. The new inflation measure will dole out the budget-cutting pain in a very gradual manner while making progress over time.\\nThe chain-weighted CPI registers slower inflation than the usual CPI because it allows for the substitution effect of price changes. When the cost of one item rises, consumers switch to a similar product that has not risen in price (or not increased as much). The substitution can occur intra-item (whole wheat bread instead of white bread) and inter-item (beer versus wine). The chained CPI takes the shifts into its calculation; the traditional CPI does not.\\nThe impact each year is small. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data for the past 10 years, yearly inflation measured by the chained CPI has run about one-quarter of a percentage point below the traditional CPI rate.\\nLower inflation slows the cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security and other entitlement programs and shifts more households into higher tax brackets. While the moves are small each year, they will add up over time.\\nAccording to a March report from the Congressional Budget Office, if Washington began using the chained CPI in fiscal 2014, the cumulative reduction in the deficit from 2014 through 2023 would be about $340 billion, or about 5% of the current projection. That\\'s not a huge cut, but it\\'s progress that will be relatively painless.\\nOne argument against switching CPIs in the case of entitlements is that spending by the elderly differs from the CPI\\'s basket of goods and services. Older consumers devote a bigger share of their spending on health care and shelter. On the other hand, they spend less on transportation, education and food.\\nThe federal budget, however, doesn\\'t take into account the inflation rates of different population groups. No accommodation is made for the higher inflation that hits taxpayers in the Northeast versus those living in the Midwest. Using different inflation rates would simply create new special-interest groups. That\\'s the last thing the budget process needs.\\nSuccessful reform has to scatter the pain around so that it falls on all parties in very small doses. The chained CPI accomplishes that. But it\\'s only one step of a long budget journey.\\nThe debate over the chained CPI could be a \"litmus test\" for serious entitlement reform this summer, write economists at HSBC. \"If opponents of the change mount a successful attack against its implementation, then progress on more substantial changes may be thwarted, as well.\"\\n', metadata={'article_id': 2, 'folder': 'cpi', 'textfile': 'cpi_2013-1-1_to_2013-7-1.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='MADRID—Spain\\'s consumer prices in January surprisingly made their steepest monthly drop in 50 years, giving cause to consumer advocates, long critical of the way the government measures inflation.\\n\"We are suspicious that there may be government policies that contribute to hide the true scale of inflation,\" said Rubén Sánchez, a spokesman for Spanish consumer advocacy association Facua. \"Our experience indicates that current calculations undervalue real inflation.\"\\nThe yardstick at issue, the INE National Statistics Institute\\'s Consumer Price Index, measures monthly price changes of a basket of more than 200 goods, including bus fares, shoes, gasoline and school fees.\\nThe institute on Friday released data similar to its flash estimate two weeks ago. It reported the January index at 102.996, a 1.3% decline from 104.298 in December. Prices are measured from a base of 100, registered in January 2011.\\nThose concerns are significant in Spain because the government uses the CPI to set annual increases in pensions and some salaries. More than half of Spanish workers covered by collective bargaining agreements have their salaries tied to the CPI, the annual rate of which in Spain is surpassed in the euro zone only by that of Belgium.\\nFor José Angel Oliván, head of the Union of Spanish Consumers, another advocacy group, the suspicion is that annual adjustments made to the products included in the CPI basket have failed to keep up with recent changes in Spanish consumption patterns during the two recessions since 2008.\\n\"Overall consumer spending in Spain has fallen over the past few years because of the crisis,\" Mr. Oliván said. \"But actual spending on basic needs is now a higher percentage of the total, and we don\\'t think that is now correctly reflected in the CPI.\"\\nIgnacio González, deputy head of the INE\\'s price department, rejected criticism of the CPI basket. He said the INE adjusts weightings in the basket on an annual basis, following the guidance of a large-scale, yearly survey of consumption patterns of 22,000 Spanish households.\\nStill, Mr. González concedes that the CPI is far from a perfect measure of the way price fluctuations affect the country\\'s population. He acknowledged that it measures only rising costs for the average household—a statistic that doesn\\'t reflect the habits of other large segments of the population, such as pensioners and unemployed, who spend a much higher percentage of their income on food and electricity.\\n\"In reality, the CPI doesn\\'t measure increases in the cost of living; it isn\\'t really designed to do that,\" Mr. González said. \"What it does, and it does it very well, is measure inflation. That is a much wider concept…If we were to create only a cost-of-living index, it would likely result in higher readings.\"\\nMr. González said a straight cost-of-living index wouldn\\'t include the so-called \"hedonic adjustments\" that are built into Spain\\'s CPI and distort real shop prices for some expensive products. An example of that, he said, is a flat-screen television that in the CPI estimate has a similar price to an older, curved-screen model, but is much more expensive in the shop.\\nThe distortion of hedonic adjustments on CPI measures is significant and does much to lower CPI estimates in Spain and elsewhere, said Tim Morgan, an economist who leads the research department at London-based Tullett Prebon.\\nHedonic and other statistical adjustments have become commonplace across the world since the mid-1990s, Mr. Morgan said, and this has served to keep CPI readings low in order to justify government policy objectives, such as low interest rates. Such obfuscations also make it easier for euro zone governments, which are trying to make their economies more competitive but have no control over exchange rates, to hold salary increases below the real rise in the cost of living, Mr. Morgan added.\\n\"If you can present numbers that mask the true extent of inflation, then you can persuade wage earners to take salary increases that are well below inflation,\" Mr. Morgan said. \"I have no doubt that this is happening all over Europe.\"\\nIndeed, consumer concerns about inflation measurement aren\\'t limited to Spain. In Italy, for example, consumer watchdog Codacons estimated this month that the country\\'s CPI reading, officially showing an annual inflation rate of 2.2% in January, was really closer to 3%.\\nChristopher Emsden contributed to this article.\\n', metadata={'article_id': 3, 'folder': 'cpi', 'textfile': 'cpi_2013-1-1_to_2013-7-1.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='What\\'s the best way to measure inflation? Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland say the answer is simple: Look at the middle.\\nConsumer prices fell 0.2% in March, the Labor Department said Tuesday, due primarily to a big drop in the price of gasoline. But seasoned Federal Reserve watchers know to ignore the headline figure and look at the \"core\" consumer price index, which ignores food and energy prices. By that metric, prices actually rose 0.1%.\\nThe focus on core inflation can be frustrating for many consumers, however. Why ignore food and gas, perhaps the two items families buy most frequently?\\nThe Fed\\'s logic is that food and energy prices are volatile. A one-month spike in the price of corn isn\\'t inflation -- it\\'s a one-month spike in the price of corn. What matters is the trend in overall prices, which means it makes sense to ignore volatile components.\\nBut in recent years, at least, food prices haven\\'t actually been particularly volatile. And in any case, the \"core\" definition can feel arbitrary. If used-car prices rise because of surge in demand after a hurricane, that \"counts\" in the inflation gauge. But if that same hurricane wipes out the year\\'s citrus crop, the resulting spike in orange-juice prices is ignored.\\nThe issue is a concern for policymakers as well as consumers. The goal of an inflation gauge is to distinguish true inflation -- a rise in the general price level -- from monthly fluctuations in prices for specific goods and services. Core CPI has historically done a better job of that than the main headline number, but it has clear drawbacks, as a trio of Cleveland Fed economists noted in a recent commentary. Permanently excluding food and energy prices treats any changes in those categories as \"noise\" -- therefore missing any actual hints of inflation they might contain -- while simultaneously treating all other price changes as inflation signals, no matter how noisy they may be.\\nThe Cleveland Fed economists propose a simple alternative: median CPI. The measure is pretty much what it sounds like: Make a list of all the price changes in a given month, stack them in order, and pick the one in the middle. (The actual methodology involves an adjustment for the different weights of the CPI components, and splits housing into four regions.) One month, the median CPI might be based on cars, the next month shoes.\\nIn March, median CPI rose 0.1%, exactly the same as the traditional core measure. But over the past year, the median CPI is up 2.1%, suggesting inflation is running a bit hotter than the core figure of 1.9% would suggest. Over time, the Cleveland researchers argue, their approach does a better job forecasting inflation than either headline or core CPI.\\n\"The median is more likely to act as an early warning system in the event that inflation starts to pick up,\" the authors write.\\nMedian CPI isn\\'t a new idea; the Cleveland Fed has been studying it for at least 20 years. But in their new paper, the researchers present evidence that despite its simplicity, median CPI does as good or better a job of predicting inflation than more complicated ways of adjusting the CPI. It also does a better job of forecasting an alternative measure of inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index, which is less familiar to the public but is preferred by the Fed.\\nMedian CPI has another advantage, the authors argue: It\\'s easy to explain. That\\'s an important factor at a time when the Fed is often criticized for being out of touch with the real world as experienced by shoppers.\\nCore CPI \"makes the [Fed] appear to be disconnected or insensitive, as it disregards subsistence items that consumers purchase much more frequently than, say, cars or new televisions,\" the authors write. \"In communicating the stance of underlying inflation, hitting the one in the middle is far superior to excluding consumer necessities like food and energy.\"\\n', metadata={'article_id': 4, 'folder': 'cpi', 'textfile': 'cpi_2013-1-1_to_2013-7-1.txt'}),\n",

This is because a home is an asset, and an increase in its value does not impose a \"cost\" on the homeowner. But there is a cost that homeowners face in addition to home maintenance and utilities, and that\\'s the implied rent they incur by living in their home rather than renting it out. In effect, every homeowner is his or her own tenant, and the rent they forgo each month is called the \"owners\\' equivalent rent\" (or OER) in the CPI. OER represents about 24 percent of the CPI (and about 11 percent of the PCE price index). The CPI captures this OER cost (sensibly, in our view) by measuring the cost of home rentals (details here). So whether the robust rise in home prices will influence the behavior of the CPI this year depends on whether rising home prices influence home rents. So what is likely to happen to OER given the continued increase in home prices? Well, higher home prices, in time, ought to cause home rents to rise, putting upward pressure on the CPI. \"\\n--Economy-Market Disconnect:Kemal Derviş looks at whether there is a disconnect between the global economy\\'s performance and financial markets. \"Financial market buoyancy is at odds with political events and real economic indicators. In the US, economic performance improved only marginally in 2012, with annual GDP rising by 2.3%, up from 1.8% in 2011. Unemployment remained high, at 7.8% at the end of 2012, and there has been almost no real wage growth over the last few years. Median household income in the US is still below its 2007 level – indeed, close to its level two decades ago – and roughly 90% of all US income gains in the post-crisis period have accrued to the top 1% of households. Indicators for the eurozone are even worse.\"\\n--Sandy Bounceback:Jaison R. Abel, Jason Bram, Richard Deitz and James Orr look at how the New York area job market bounced back from Hurricane Sandy. \"Last October, Superstorm Sandy caused widespread destruction and massive disruptions to the regional economy, not to mention the lives of millions of residents. More than three months later, many people remain displaced, and some are still struggling to rebuild their homes, businesses, and lives. Despite these setbacks, the process of economic recovery in the region appears to be well underway, boosted by the beginning of the cleanup and restoration process.

The administration proposal would switch to using a measure known as chain-weighted consumer price index, or chained CPI-- that tends to show slower inflation than the index used currently. So, the size of the standard deduction, for example, would rise more slowly as well. Tax bracket income cutoffs would rise more slowly as well.\\nThat means a household taking the standard deduction would deduct less over time if chained CPI were used than if the current measure were used. And many workers with rising incomes could get thrown into higher tax brackets sooner under the new approach than under current one. That would make more income taxable, and generate more tax revenue for the government.\\nBy 2021, the change would raise taxes by about $100 a year on almost all households earning more than about $30,000, according to estimates by the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution.\\n\"Chained CPI raises taxes by more than $100 billion over decade,\" Grover Norquist, president of the conservative Americans for Tax Reform, tweeted on Friday. \"Unless it is offset by larger tax cuts in same bill it is a TAX HIKE.

The measure, called the chained consumer price index, would lower the annual payment increases for Social Security beneficiaries, saving the government money as it lowers the future monthly income of retirees and disabled Americans. The change would also raise revenue over time because it would cause more taxpayers to wind up in higher marginal brackets.What neither side seems to have noticed, however, is that the difference between the chained CPI and the standard CPI has been diminishing.

But this connection has been stretched of late. Since September 2009 share prices have risen 132%, whereas the unemployment rate, which peaked at 10% a month later, has fallen rather more slowly. And last week, as the S&P 500 hit an all-time high, unemployment was edging down as far as 7.6%. This is a sign of a decoupling between corporate profitability and labour-market strength, which reflects the increasingly globalised nature of America\\'s businesses and the boon to capital of pools of cheap labour (real average wages in America are 16% below their 1973 peak). After adjusting for inflation, the S&P 500 is still 25% below its March 2000 high, though shares remain 35% overvalued when measured against the cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio created by Robert Shiller, an economist.

Residential rent in Shanghai is up 13% from a year ago, according to Centaline, another property agency.\\nThat makes sense. China's economy is awash in cash. Money supply expanded 13.8% year-on-year in 2012, compared with 7.8% growth in gross domestic product. A massive increase in new credit in the first two months of 2013 accelerated money-supply growth to 15.2%. Wages are rising at double digit rates.\\nThe markets cheered March's relatively benign price rise. The Hang Seng China Enterprise Index gained 1.9% Tuesday. But if inflation is higher than CPI suggests, official data is not a good predictor of the need for tighter monetary policy.\\n\", metadata={'article_id': 9, 'folder': 'cpi', 'textfile': 'cpi_2013-1-1_to_2013-7-1.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='President Barack Obama\\'s budget on Wednesday will propose slowing the growth of Social Security and other benefits, but include measures to shield a broad range of Americans from the plan\\'s full impact, including very old recipients as well as low-income seniors and veterans.\\nThat could provide some solace to critics of the idea, known as \"chained CPI,\" which would change the government\\'s method of calculating cost-of-living adjustments so they rise more slowly. Many liberals as well as the seniors group AARP object to the idea, contending it puts an unfair burden on older Americans.\\nMany centrist Democrats are willing to consider it as a way to curb the growth of spending on government benefits, but only if it is carefully tailored to protect certain groups and paired with higher taxes on the wealthy.\\nWhite House officials have said they would propose adopting chained CPI with \"protections for vulnerable\" Americans, but haven\\'t released details on the protections or how they define that group.\\nObama senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said Sunday on ABC it would include \"the oldest seniors.\"\\nOn Monday, a person familiar with the situation said very-low-income seniors and veterans also would be shielded, but didn\\'t say how. Other protections also would be included, the person said.\\nBut critics note that even a small reduction in benefits would be keenly felt. Monthly Social Security payments account for more than 90% of income for one third of seniors, or roughly 15 million people, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank.\\nThe numbers are even starker for those aged 80 and older, many who have dwindling or exhausted retirement savings. The CBPP estimates that Social Security provides nearly all the income for 45% of those in this age category.\\nThe rationale for making the change in how cost-of-living adjustments are calculated is that the chained CPI inflation measure better accounts for consumers\\' behavior, for example when they react to a product\\'s price increase by switching to cheaper alternatives.\\nBut critics say seniors spend more on fast-growing health care costs than other Americans and that chained CPI ignores this difference.\\nAnother concern about chained CPI is that the reduction in benefits would compound over time. For example, AARP estimates that someone who begins receiving $15,190 yearly in Social Security benefits in 2013 would see them rise the next year by $46 less under the chained CPI approach than under the current method.\\nBut by age 90, in 2038, the person\\'s annual benefits would be $2,135 less per year under chained CPI (a cut of roughly $1,000 in constant dollars).\\n\"It\\'s reasonable to consider it, if the proposal includes strong protections for the very old and people with low incomes,\" said Robert Greenstein, CBPP\\'s president. It should only be done as part of a broader package of fiscal changes that includes closing tax breaks for the wealthy, he said.\\nAllowing exceptions to the policy would reduce the amount of deficit reduction achieved by the measure.\\nCongressional budget experts recently estimated that switching to chained CPI for all federal benefits could reduce spending by as much as $216 billion over the next decade, assuming no big exceptions.\\nThe administration has estimated that its proposal would reduce spending by about $130 billion over a decade, assuming \"vulnerable\" beneficiaries are protected.\\nThe change also would increase revenues by as much as $124 billion by moving people into higher tax brackets slightly faster and increasing tax collections, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\\nWrite to John D.

CPI notified Sears the next day, and by April 5 the portrait studio had stopped snapping photos.\\nSears Holding Corp. terminated its agreement with CPI as of April 5, according to disclosures filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Toys \"R\" Us Inc., which also had an agreement with CPI, demanded immediate payment of $568,443 and terminated its contract with CPI.

       "  'When President Barack Obama introduces his budget proposal Wednesday, one expected twist is adopting a new cost-of-living calculation. Instead of the traditional consumer price index, the budget would use the so-called chain-weighted CPI.\\nIt is a good idea. The new inflation measure will dole out the budget-cutting pain in a very gradual manner while making progress over time.\\nThe chain-weighted CPI registers slower inflation than the usual CPI because it allows for the substitution effect of price changes. When the cost of one item rises, consumers switch to a similar product that has not risen in price (or not increased as much). The substitution can occur intra-item (whole wheat bread instead of white bread) and inter-item (beer versus wine). The chained CPI takes the shifts into its calculation; the traditional CPI does not.\\nThe impact each year is small. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data for the past 10 years, yearly inflation measured by the chained CPI has run about one-quarter of a percentage point below the traditional CPI rate.\\nLower inflation slows the cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security and other entitlement programs and shifts more households into higher tax brackets. While the moves are small each year, they will add up over time.\\nAccording to a March report from the Congressional Budget Office, if Washington began using the chained CPI in fiscal 2014, the cumulative reduction in the deficit from 2014 through 2023 would be about $340 billion, or about 5% of the current projection. That\\'s not a huge cut, but it\\'s progress that will be relatively painless.\\nOne argument against switching CPIs in the case of entitlements is that spending by the elderly differs from the CPI\\'s basket of goods and services. Older consumers devote a bigger share of their spending on health care and shelter. On the other hand, they spend less on transportation, education and food.\\nThe federal budget, however, doesn\\'t take into account the inflation rates of different population groups. No accommodation is made for the higher inflation that hits taxpayers in the Northeast versus those living in the Midwest. Using different inflation rates would simply create new special-interest groups. That\\'s the last thing the budget process needs.\\nSuccessful reform has to scatter the pain around so that it falls on all parties in very small doses. The chained CPI accomplishes that. But it\\'s only one step of a long budget journey.\\nThe debate over the chained CPI could be a \"litmus test\" for serious entitlement reform this summer, write economists at HSBC. \"If opponents of the change mount a successful attack against its implementation, then progress on more substantial changes may be thwarted, as well.\"\\n',\n",
       "  'MADRID—Spain\\'s consumer prices in January surprisingly made their steepest monthly drop in 50 years, giving cause to consumer advocates, long critical of the way the government measures inflation.\\n\"We are suspicious that there may be government policies that contribute to hide the true scale of inflation,\" said Rubén Sánchez, a spokesman for Spanish consumer advocacy association Facua. \"Our experience indicates that current calculations undervalue real inflation.\"\\nThe yardstick at issue, the INE National Statistics Institute\\'s Consumer Price Index, measures monthly price changes of a basket of more than 200 goods, including bus fares, shoes, gasoline and school fees.\\nThe institute on Friday released data similar to its flash estimate two weeks ago. It reported the January index at 102.996, a 1.3% decline from 104.298 in December. Prices are measured from a base of 100, registered in January 2011.\\nThose concerns are significant in Spain because the government uses the CPI to set annual increases in pensions and some salaries. More than half of Spanish workers covered by collective bargaining agreements have their salaries tied to the CPI, the annual rate of which in Spain is surpassed in the euro zone only by that of Belgium.\\nFor José Angel Oliván, head of the Union of Spanish Consumers, another advocacy group, the suspicion is that annual adjustments made to the products included in the CPI basket have failed to keep up with recent changes in Spanish consumption patterns during the two recessions since 2008.\\n\"Overall consumer spending in Spain has fallen over the past few years because of the crisis,\" Mr. Oliván said. \"But actual spending on basic needs is now a higher percentage of the total, and we don\\'t think that is now correctly reflected in the CPI.\"\\nIgnacio González, deputy head of the INE\\'s price department, rejected criticism of the CPI basket. He said the INE adjusts weightings in the basket on an annual basis, following the guidance of a large-scale, yearly survey of consumption patterns of 22,000 Spanish households.\\nStill, Mr. González concedes that the CPI is far from a perfect measure of the way price fluctuations affect the country\\'s population. He acknowledged that it measures only rising costs for the average household—a statistic that doesn\\'t reflect the habits of other large segments of the population, such as pensioners and unemployed, who spend a much higher percentage of their income on food and electricity.\\n\"In reality, the CPI doesn\\'t measure increases in the cost of living; it isn\\'t really designed to do that,\" Mr. González said. \"What it does, and it does it very well, is measure inflation. That is a much wider concept…If we were to create only a cost-of-living index, it would likely result in higher readings.\"\\nMr. González said a straight cost-of-living index wouldn\\'t include the so-called \"hedonic adjustments\" that are built into Spain\\'s CPI and distort real shop prices for some expensive products. An example of that, he said, is a flat-screen television that in the CPI estimate has a similar price to an older, curved-screen model, but is much more expensive in the shop.\\nThe distortion of hedonic adjustments on CPI measures is significant and does much to lower CPI estimates in Spain and elsewhere, said Tim Morgan, an economist who leads the research department at London-based Tullett Prebon.\\nHedonic and other statistical adjustments have become commonplace across the world since the mid-1990s, Mr. Morgan said, and this has served to keep CPI readings low in order to justify government policy objectives, such as low interest rates. Such obfuscations also make it easier for euro zone governments, which are trying to make their economies more competitive but have no control over exchange rates, to hold salary increases below the real rise in the cost of living, Mr. Morgan added.\\n\"If you can present numbers that mask the true extent of inflation, then you can persuade wage earners to take salary increases that are well below inflation,\" Mr. Morgan said. \"I have no doubt that this is happening all over Europe.\"\\nIndeed, consumer concerns about inflation measurement aren\\'t limited to Spain. In Italy, for example, consumer watchdog Codacons estimated this month that the country\\'s CPI reading, officially showing an annual inflation rate of 2.2% in January, was really closer to 3%.\\nChristopher Emsden contributed to this article.\\n',\n",
       "  'What\\'s the best way to measure inflation? Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland say the answer is simple: Look at the middle.\\nConsumer prices fell 0.2% in March, the Labor Department said Tuesday, due primarily to a big drop in the price of gasoline. But seasoned Federal Reserve watchers know to ignore the headline figure and look at the \"core\" consumer price index, which ignores food and energy prices. By that metric, prices actually rose 0.1%.\\nThe focus on core inflation can be frustrating for many consumers, however. Why ignore food and gas, perhaps the two items families buy most frequently?\\nThe Fed\\'s logic is that food and energy prices are volatile. A one-month spike in the price of corn isn\\'t inflation -- it\\'s a one-month spike in the price of corn. What matters is the trend in overall prices, which means it makes sense to ignore volatile components.\\nBut in recent years, at least, food prices haven\\'t actually been particularly volatile. And in any case, the \"core\" definition can feel arbitrary. If used-car prices rise because of surge in demand after a hurricane, that \"counts\" in the inflation gauge. But if that same hurricane wipes out the year\\'s citrus crop, the resulting spike in orange-juice prices is ignored.\\nThe issue is a concern for policymakers as well as consumers. The goal of an inflation gauge is to distinguish true inflation -- a rise in the general price level -- from monthly fluctuations in prices for specific goods and services. Core CPI has historically done a better job of that than the main headline number, but it has clear drawbacks, as a trio of Cleveland Fed economists noted in a recent commentary. Permanently excluding food and energy prices treats any changes in those categories as \"noise\" -- therefore missing any actual hints of inflation they might contain -- while simultaneously treating all other price changes as inflation signals, no matter how noisy they may be.\\nThe Cleveland Fed economists propose a simple alternative: median CPI. The measure is pretty much what it sounds like: Make a list of all the price changes in a given month, stack them in order, and pick the one in the middle. (The actual methodology involves an adjustment for the different weights of the CPI components, and splits housing into four regions.) One month, the median CPI might be based on cars, the next month shoes.\\nIn March, median CPI rose 0.1%, exactly the same as the traditional core measure. But over the past year, the median CPI is up 2.1%, suggesting inflation is running a bit hotter than the core figure of 1.9% would suggest. Over time, the Cleveland researchers argue, their approach does a better job forecasting inflation than either headline or core CPI.\\n\"The median is more likely to act as an early warning system in the event that inflation starts to pick up,\" the authors write.\\nMedian CPI isn\\'t a new idea; the Cleveland Fed has been studying it for at least 20 years. But in their new paper, the researchers present evidence that despite its simplicity, median CPI does as good or better a job of predicting inflation than more complicated ways of adjusting the CPI. It also does a better job of forecasting an alternative measure of inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index, which is less familiar to the public but is preferred by the Fed.\\nMedian CPI has another advantage, the authors argue: It\\'s easy to explain. That\\'s an important factor at a time when the Fed is often criticized for being out of touch with the real world as experienced by shoppers.\\nCore CPI \"makes the [Fed] appear to be disconnected or insensitive, as it disregards subsistence items that consumers purchase much more frequently than, say, cars or new televisions,\" the authors write. \"In communicating the stance of underlying inflation, hitting the one in the middle is far superior to excluding consumer necessities like food and energy.\"\\n',\n",
       "  'A roundup of economic news from around the Web.\\n--Housing and Inflation:Mike Bryan and Nick Parker provide a useful overview on how housing affects inflation. \"Home prices do not directly enter into the computation of the CPI (or the personal consumption expenditures [PCE] price index, for that matter). This is because a home is an asset, and an increase in its value does not impose a \"cost\" on the homeowner. But there is a cost that homeowners face in addition to home maintenance and utilities, and that\\'s the implied rent they incur by living in their home rather than renting it out. In effect, every homeowner is his or her own tenant, and the rent they forgo each month is called the \"owners\\' equivalent rent\" (or OER) in the CPI. OER represents about 24 percent of the CPI (and about 11 percent of the PCE price index). The CPI captures this OER cost (sensibly, in our view) by measuring the cost of home rentals (details here). So whether the robust rise in home prices will influence the behavior of the CPI this year depends on whether rising home prices influence home rents. So what is likely to happen to OER given the continued increase in home prices? Well, higher home prices, in time, ought to cause home rents to rise, putting upward pressure on the CPI. \"\\n--Economy-Market Disconnect:Kemal Derviş looks at whether there is a disconnect between the global economy\\'s performance and financial markets. \"Financial market buoyancy is at odds with political events and real economic indicators. In the US, economic performance improved only marginally in 2012, with annual GDP rising by 2.3%, up from 1.8% in 2011. Unemployment remained high, at 7.8% at the end of 2012, and there has been almost no real wage growth over the last few years. Median household income in the US is still below its 2007 level – indeed, close to its level two decades ago – and roughly 90% of all US income gains in the post-crisis period have accrued to the top 1% of households. Indicators for the eurozone are even worse.\"\\n--Sandy Bounceback:Jaison R. Abel, Jason Bram, Richard Deitz and James Orr look at how the New York area job market bounced back from Hurricane Sandy. \"Last October, Superstorm Sandy caused widespread destruction and massive disruptions to the regional economy, not to mention the lives of millions of residents. More than three months later, many people remain displaced, and some are still struggling to rebuild their homes, businesses, and lives. Despite these setbacks, the process of economic recovery in the region appears to be well underway, boosted by the beginning of the cleanup and restoration process. In this post, we take an initial look at the adverse impact Sandy has had on the region\\'s jobs, describing the nature and extent of the employment downturn and the subsequent rebound following the storm.\"\\nCompiled by Phil Izzo\\n',\n",
       "  'Liberal Democrats aren\\'t the only ones who don\\'t like President Barack Obama\\'s proposal to use a different inflation measure for adjusting a wide swath of federal programs to keep up with the rising cost of living.\\nWhile many liberals hate the idea because federal benefits such as Social Security would grow more slowly, some conservatives oppose it because taxes would rise faster for many Americans.\\nThat\\'s because many features of the tax code, such as the size of the standard deduction and the income thresholds for tax brackets, are adjusted annually for inflation. The administration proposal would switch to using a measure known as chain-weighted consumer price index, or chained CPI-- that tends to show slower inflation than the index used currently. So, the size of the standard deduction, for example, would rise more slowly as well. Tax bracket income cutoffs would rise more slowly as well.\\nThat means a household taking the standard deduction would deduct less over time if chained CPI were used than if the current measure were used. And many workers with rising incomes could get thrown into higher tax brackets sooner under the new approach than under current one. That would make more income taxable, and generate more tax revenue for the government.\\nBy 2021, the change would raise taxes by about $100 a year on almost all households earning more than about $30,000, according to estimates by the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution.\\n\"Chained CPI raises taxes by more than $100 billion over decade,\" Grover Norquist, president of the conservative Americans for Tax Reform, tweeted on Friday. \"Unless it is offset by larger tax cuts in same bill it is a TAX HIKE. BAD.\"\\nSome conservative theorists say even the current measure of inflation is too generous to the government when it comes to the tax system. They note household income tends to rise faster than prices, so tax brackets should be reset every year using a measure showing faster inflation, not slower.\\nBut congressional Republican leaders have embraced the switch to chained CPI, included in Mr. Obama\\'s budget plan released Wednesday, viewing it as a foot in the door for larger restraints in the growth of spending on entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare.\\nMore on the Budget\\n',\n",
       "  'A roundup of economic news from around the Web.\\n--Chained CPI:Peter Orszag says chained CPI may not be a big money saver. \"News that the White House will propose a new cost-of-living index in the budget it releases this week has brought joy to deficit scolds and consternation to defenders of Social Security. The measure, called the chained consumer price index, would lower the annual payment increases for Social Security beneficiaries, saving the government money as it lowers the future monthly income of retirees and disabled Americans. The change would also raise revenue over time because it would cause more taxpayers to wind up in higher marginal brackets.What neither side seems to have noticed, however, is that the difference between the chained CPI and the standard CPI has been diminishing. That means the impact of switching indexes may not be as great as many assume. The change may still be a good idea, but it probably won\\'t matter as much as expected.\"\\n--Stocks and Unemployment: The Economist charts stock performance against the unemployment rate. \"The relationship between equity markets and unemployment is complex: since the early 1990s America\\'s unemployment rate has tended broadly to mirror the movements of the S&P 500 index of share prices. But this connection has been stretched of late. Since September 2009 share prices have risen 132%, whereas the unemployment rate, which peaked at 10% a month later, has fallen rather more slowly. And last week, as the S&P 500 hit an all-time high, unemployment was edging down as far as 7.6%. This is a sign of a decoupling between corporate profitability and labour-market strength, which reflects the increasingly globalised nature of America\\'s businesses and the boon to capital of pools of cheap labour (real average wages in America are 16% below their 1973 peak). After adjusting for inflation, the S&P 500 is still 25% below its March 2000 high, though shares remain 35% overvalued when measured against the cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio created by Robert Shiller, an economist. If cash-rich companies invest their hoards or return them to shareholders, who may also invest them, that could kick-start the real economy and hasten the decline in unemployment.\"\\n--Imports Mary Amiti and Amit Khandelwal ask whether import competition makes domestic goods better. \"Exposing domestic firms to foreign competition affects the quality of exports. Importantly, the effect of import competition on quality upgrading depends on the product\\'s quality relative to that of its competitors: Lower tariffs promote quality upgrading of products close to the world quality frontier but discourage quality upgrading for those far away from it. For these results to hold, a country must have a good business environment.\"\\nCompiled by Phil Izzo\\n',\n",

However, the company has struggled financially, hurt by the rise of digital photography.\\nThe news came suddenly to the retailers. \"We were notified Thursday that CPI is ceasing its U.S. operations at retailers across the country immediately,\" Sears spokesman Howard Riefs said. CPI has provided photo services for Sears\\'s customers since 1959 and has been the store\\'s only portrait studio operator since 1986, currently located in all 788 Sears stores in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.\\nSears \"is exploring all options\" to potentially provide portrait services as soon as possible, Mr. Riefs said.\\nThe look and feel of the photographs—cloth backdrops, wide smiles and subjects looking slightly off-camera—became part of the visual dictionary of creative artists, being re-appropriated for everything from a band photo by the Red Hot Chili Peppers to the film poster for \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin.\"\\nOne former customer, Becky Schaaf, used to take her 4-year-old son to a Sears Portrait Studio every three months during the first year of his life, until she decided she could get the same result, or better, on her own or by finding local professionals.\\n\"We started to realize that with a decent camera we could be taking strong photos,\" said Ms. Schaaf, now a mother of two in Ashland, Ohio. \"I just got an iPhone…[and] for the day to day, we\\'re just as happy with that.\"\\nCPI\\'s shares, traded on the Pink Sheets, hovered around 6 cents Friday. The company had about 12,000 employees, including temporary and part-time workers, and operated nearly 1,900 Wal-Mart studios world-wide as of February 2012.\\nThe retailers said they are making sure customers get their photos, with Wal-Mart providing them at its customer-service counters and Sears saying it is working with CPI.\\n\"We are attempting to fulfill as many customer orders as possible,\" CPI said in its online statement.\\nA Wal-Mart spokeswoman said CPI operated in less than 20% of U.S. stores.

       "  \"In China, it's common for shoppers to haggle on prices. Investors should quibble over the country's inflation data, too.\\nOfficial figures show China's consumer price index easing to 2.1% year-on-year in March from 3.2% in February. That's not unexpected. In February, food prices were higher because of the Lunar New Year, which in 2012 occurred in January. With the celebrations over, food-price increases slowed.\\nBut Chinese households have long harbored suspicions that the CPI is not capturing all of the price increases they face. Some Internet users joke that government statisticians don't buy their own groceries so they don't know how much things cost.\\nData from Alibaba, China's biggest online-shopping platform, suggests the skeptics may have a point. Based on online transactions, Alibaba's Internet shopping price index shows that prices in February were up 11% from a year earlier. Alibaba sells a different range of goods than what's in the CPI basket, but the difference between its number and the official figure is striking nonetheless.\\nProperty prices in major cities are rising fast too. Data from property agency Soufun shows prices in Guangzhou and Beijing rising at double-digit rates. Residential rent in Shanghai is up 13% from a year ago, according to Centaline, another property agency.\\nThat makes sense. China's economy is awash in cash. Money supply expanded 13.8% year-on-year in 2012, compared with 7.8% growth in gross domestic product. A massive increase in new credit in the first two months of 2013 accelerated money-supply growth to 15.2%. Wages are rising at double digit rates.\\nThe markets cheered March's relatively benign price rise. The Hang Seng China Enterprise Index gained 1.9% Tuesday. But if inflation is higher than CPI suggests, official data is not a good predictor of the need for tighter monetary policy.\\n\",\n",
       "  'President Barack Obama\\'s budget on Wednesday will propose slowing the growth of Social Security and other benefits, but include measures to shield a broad range of Americans from the plan\\'s full impact, including very old recipients as well as low-income seniors and veterans.\\nThat could provide some solace to critics of the idea, known as \"chained CPI,\" which would change the government\\'s method of calculating cost-of-living adjustments so they rise more slowly. Many liberals as well as the seniors group AARP object to the idea, contending it puts an unfair burden on older Americans.\\nMany centrist Democrats are willing to consider it as a way to curb the growth of spending on government benefits, but only if it is carefully tailored to protect certain groups and paired with higher taxes on the wealthy.\\nWhite House officials have said they would propose adopting chained CPI with \"protections for vulnerable\" Americans, but haven\\'t released details on the protections or how they define that group.\\nObama senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said Sunday on ABC it would include \"the oldest seniors.\"\\nOn Monday, a person familiar with the situation said very-low-income seniors and veterans also would be shielded, but didn\\'t say how. Other protections also would be included, the person said.\\nBut critics note that even a small reduction in benefits would be keenly felt. Monthly Social Security payments account for more than 90% of income for one third of seniors, or roughly 15 million people, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank.\\nThe numbers are even starker for those aged 80 and older, many who have dwindling or exhausted retirement savings. The CBPP estimates that Social Security provides nearly all the income for 45% of those in this age category.\\nThe rationale for making the change in how cost-of-living adjustments are calculated is that the chained CPI inflation measure better accounts for consumers\\' behavior, for example when they react to a product\\'s price increase by switching to cheaper alternatives.\\nBut critics say seniors spend more on fast-growing health care costs than other Americans and that chained CPI ignores this difference.\\nAnother concern about chained CPI is that the reduction in benefits would compound over time. For example, AARP estimates that someone who begins receiving $15,190 yearly in Social Security benefits in 2013 would see them rise the next year by $46 less under the chained CPI approach than under the current method.\\nBut by age 90, in 2038, the person\\'s annual benefits would be $2,135 less per year under chained CPI (a cut of roughly $1,000 in constant dollars).\\n\"It\\'s reasonable to consider it, if the proposal includes strong protections for the very old and people with low incomes,\" said Robert Greenstein, CBPP\\'s president. It should only be done as part of a broader package of fiscal changes that includes closing tax breaks for the wealthy, he said.\\nAllowing exceptions to the policy would reduce the amount of deficit reduction achieved by the measure.\\nCongressional budget experts recently estimated that switching to chained CPI for all federal benefits could reduce spending by as much as $216 billion over the next decade, assuming no big exceptions.\\nThe administration has estimated that its proposal would reduce spending by about $130 billion over a decade, assuming \"vulnerable\" beneficiaries are protected.\\nThe change also would increase revenues by as much as $124 billion by moving people into higher tax brackets slightly faster and increasing tax collections, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\\nWrite to John D.

       "'If you’re looking for the most accurate view of economic growth, you won’t find it in the government’s top-line statistics. Last month the Bureau of Economic Analysis revised its estimate for the first quarter of 2018; the BEA now says gross domestic product grew 2%, annualized, down from the previous figure of 2.2%. This dramatically understates the economy’s actual performance. A better measure, factoring in statistics on incomes, shows growth steaming along at a much stronger 2.8%.\\nWhy the difference? In short, because the data aren’t perfect. Unlike the unemployment rate, which comes from a (relatively) straightforward survey, GDP is not measured directly. Instead, the BEA sums up economy-wide expenditures from dozens of data sources, covering consumption, investment, government spending, net exports and more.\\nLast month’s figure was the BEA’s third estimate for the first quarter. Yet at this stage the statisticians have comprehensive data on only 38.5% of GDP. Most of the rest was inferred using direct or indirect indicators, such as by taking the number of housing starts as a proxy for dollars invested in new home construction. For 12% of GDP, the statisticians used “trend-based data,” which essentially amounts to extrapolation and guess work. To take a couple of specific examples, the BEA had a reasonably accurate measure of cars bought in the first quarter, but it had to guess how much financial services were purchased.\\nProducing the most accurate statistics can be costly, complicated and fraught with these kinds of measurement problems. Despite the best efforts of the BEA’s excellent civil servants, the underlying data are noisy and incomplete, meaning that revisions to GDP growth estimates can be large and often confusing. The average absolute revision from 1993 through 2016 was 1.3 percentage point.\\nDrawing on more data can cancel out some of this noise and produce a more accurate figure that requires smaller revisions. Specifically, the BEA separately gauges the size of the economy by adding up all the different sources of income, such as wages and profits. This figure is called gross domestic income, or GDI, and in the first quarter of 2018 it grew by an estimated 3.6%, annualized.\\nUltimately, GDI should be identical to GDP, since all money spent is money earned. But in practice the published estimates differ because the data are subject to different errors and reflect different guesses. Research shows that a simple average of GDP and GDI is a nearly optimal way to combine the two sets of information. For the first quarter it averages to 2.8% growth. That is the best predictor of what the government will eventually estimate for GDP after several years of revisions.\\nThe BEA’s statisticians already report this number, which they call “average of GDP and GDI,” but they bury it, and the financial press and analysts usually ignore it. The BEA should immediately start reporting this figure as its headline growth estimate, because it is the most accurate way to measure the economy. Until it does, serious analysts can help themselves by playing down the noisier GDP data and focusing on the average, which better captures the economic signal.\\nWith more time and resources, the BEA should integrate data from expenditures and incomes together into a single unified estimate, as many countries, including the United Kingdom and Canada, already do. When the BEA is filling in the blanks for the missing data on financial services, for example, it could choose numbers from both sources to create a combined best guess.\\nThe additional accuracy would be beneficial for businesses and policy makers planning for the future. But accuracy becomes even more important when the economy may be entering a recession. Since estimating GDP involves extrapolating past performance, it overstates growth when things turn sharply downward. As the economy entered a tailspin at the end of 2008, the original report for the fourth quarter had GDP growth at minus 3.8%. That was eventually revised to minus 8.2%.\\nThe BEA should fix the presentation of these data before the next major recession. An easy statistical change is all the Trump administration needs to MAGA: Measure American Growth Accurately.\\nMr. Furman, a professor of practice at the Harvard Kennedy School, was chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, 2013-17.\\n'"

       "   'article_text': 'If you’re looking for the most accurate view of economic growth, you won’t find it in the government’s top-line statistics. Last month the Bureau of Economic Analysis revised its estimate for the first quarter of 2018; the BEA now says gross domestic product grew 2%, annualized, down from the previous figure of 2.2%. This dramatically understates the economy’s actual performance. A better measure, factoring in statistics on incomes, shows growth steaming along at a much stronger 2.8%.\\nWhy the difference? In short, because the data aren’t perfect. Unlike the unemployment rate, which comes from a (relatively) straightforward survey, GDP is not measured directly. Instead, the BEA sums up economy-wide expenditures from dozens of data sources, covering consumption, investment, government spending, net exports and more.\\nLast month’s figure was the BEA’s third estimate for the first quarter. Yet at this stage the statisticians have comprehensive data on only 38.5% of GDP. Most of the rest was inferred using direct or indirect indicators, such as by taking the number of housing starts as a proxy for dollars invested in new home construction. For 12% of GDP, the statisticians used “trend-based data,” which essentially amounts to extrapolation and guess work. To take a couple of specific examples, the BEA had a reasonably accurate measure of cars bought in the first quarter, but it had to guess how much financial services were purchased.\\nProducing the most accurate statistics can be costly, complicated and fraught with these kinds of measurement problems. Despite the best efforts of the BEA’s excellent civil servants, the underlying data are noisy and incomplete, meaning that revisions to GDP growth estimates can be large and often confusing. The average absolute revision from 1993 through 2016 was 1.3 percentage point.\\nDrawing on more data can cancel out some of this noise and produce a more accurate figure that requires smaller revisions. Specifically, the BEA separately gauges the size of the economy by adding up all the different sources of income, such as wages and profits. This figure is called gross domestic income, or GDI, and in the first quarter of 2018 it grew by an estimated 3.6%, annualized.\\nUltimately, GDI should be identical to GDP, since all money spent is money earned. But in practice the published estimates differ because the data are subject to different errors and reflect different guesses. Research shows that a simple average of GDP and GDI is a nearly optimal way to combine the two sets of information. For the first quarter it averages to 2.8% growth. That is the best predictor of what the government will eventually estimate for GDP after several years of revisions.\\nThe BEA’s statisticians already report this number, which they call “average of GDP and GDI,” but they bury it, and the financial press and analysts usually ignore it. The BEA should immediately start reporting this figure as its headline growth estimate, because it is the most accurate way to measure the economy. Until it does, serious analysts can help themselves by playing down the noisier GDP data and focusing on the average, which better captures the economic signal.\\nWith more time and resources, the BEA should integrate data from expenditures and incomes together into a single unified estimate, as many countries, including the United Kingdom and Canada, already do. When the BEA is filling in the blanks for the missing data on financial services, for example, it could choose numbers from both sources to create a combined best guess.\\nThe additional accuracy would be beneficial for businesses and policy makers planning for the future. But accuracy becomes even more important when the economy may be entering a recession. Since estimating GDP involves extrapolating past performance, it overstates growth when things turn sharply downward. As the economy entered a tailspin at the end of 2008, the original report for the fourth quarter had GDP growth at minus 3.8%. That was eventually revised to minus 8.2%.\\nThe BEA should fix the presentation of these data before the next major recession. An easy statistical change is all the Trump administration needs to MAGA: Measure American Growth Accurately.\\nMr. Furman, a professor of practice at the Harvard Kennedy School, was chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, 2013-17.\\n'}),\n",

With the synchronized global growth upturn in the rearview mirror, the downturn is no longer a forecast, but is now a fact,” Lakshman Achuthan and Anirvan Banerji write for Bloomberg View. “Quarter-over-quarter annualized gross domestic product growth rates in the three largest advanced economies—the U.S., the euro zone, and Japan—have turned down. In all three, GDP growth peaked in the second or third quarter of 2017, and fell in the fourth quarter. This is what the start of a synchronized global growth downswing looks like…The current situation is reminiscent of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner cartoons. Intent of chasing his nemesis, the coyote almost always misses a sharp turn in the road, running right over a cliff edge. He realizes too late that he’s in midair, and plunges into the chasm below.

       "   'article_text': 'The Bureau of Economic Analysis will release its preliminary first-quarter growth figure on Friday. According to the Atlanta Fed consensus tracker, economists are predicting gross domestic product to have risen at a meager 2% annual rate. But a powerful behind-the-scenes indicator suggests the real rate may turn out to be significantly higher.\\n“Gross output,” or GO, reflects the full value of the supply chain—the business-to-business spending that moves all goods and services toward the final retail market. Based on my work and research by David Ranson, chief economist at HCWE & Co., changes in the supply chain are a strong leading indicator of the next quarter’s GDP.\\nThe supply chain, which the BEA calls “intermediate inputs,” took off in the fourth quarter of 2017, growing at a 7.5% annualized rate. That’s more than double the rate of real GDP growth and the fastest pace since before the Great Recession. Real GO, which includes both GDP and the supply chain, rose at a 4.7% rate. The growth was broad-based, with strong numbers in mining, manufacturing, utilities and construction. The fourth quarter 2017 GDP growth rate of 2.9% did not reflect the dramatic increases in intermediate outputs because GDP by definition measures only spending at the end of the economic chain.\\nThe GO model is more in keeping with the Conference Board’s list of 10 leading economic indicators, which are linked to manufacturing and capital markets. For three quarters in a row in 2017, GO accelerated, probably due to the anticipated tax breaks and deregulatory environment. The boom in intermediate business activity should translate into higher economic growth soon, barring international instability, trade wars, or tighter-than-expected monetary policy.\\nAs I noted in these pages in 2014, measuring gross output is a breakthrough in national income accounting. By reporting GO as well as GDP, the BEA has helped economists catch up with the accounting and finance professions. Public companies have long reported the top line (revenue) and the bottom line (profit) at the same time each quarter. For a national economy, GO corresponds to the top line (total activity) and GDP to the bottom line (final product). As the economists Dale Jorgenson, J. Steven Landefeld and William Nordhaus wrote in a 2006 book: “Gross output [GO] is the natural measure of the production sector, while net output [GDP] is appropriate as a measure of welfare.

       "   'article_text': 'The Bureau of Economic Analysis will release its preliminary first-quarter growth figure on Friday. According to the Atlanta Fed consensus tracker, economists are predicting gross domestic product to have risen at a meager 2% annual rate. But a powerful behind-the-scenes indicator suggests the real rate may turn out to be significantly higher.\\n“Gross output,” or GO, reflects the full value of the supply chain—the business-to-business spending that moves all goods and services toward the final retail market. Based on my work and research by David Ranson, chief economist at HCWE & Co., changes in the supply chain are a strong leading indicator of the next quarter’s GDP.\\nThe supply chain, which the BEA calls “intermediate inputs,” took off in the fourth quarter of 2017, growing at a 7.5% annualized rate. That’s more than double the rate of real GDP growth and the fastest pace since before the Great Recession. Real GO, which includes both GDP and the supply chain, rose at a 4.7% rate. The growth was broad-based, with strong numbers in mining, manufacturing, utilities and construction. The fourth quarter 2017 GDP growth rate of 2.9% did not reflect the dramatic increases in intermediate outputs because GDP by definition measures only spending at the end of the economic chain.\\nThe GO model is more in keeping with the Conference Board’s list of 10 leading economic indicators, which are linked to manufacturing and capital markets. For three quarters in a row in 2017, GO accelerated, probably due to the anticipated tax breaks and deregulatory environment. The boom in intermediate business activity should translate into higher economic growth soon, barring international instability, trade wars, or tighter-than-expected monetary policy.\\nAs I noted in these pages in 2014, measuring gross output is a breakthrough in national income accounting. By reporting GO as well as GDP, the BEA has helped economists catch up with the accounting and finance professions. Public companies have long reported the top line (revenue) and the bottom line (profit) at the same time each quarter. For a national economy, GO corresponds to the top line (total activity) and GDP to the bottom line (final product). As the economists Dale Jorgenson, J. Steven Landefeld and William Nordhaus wrote in a 2006 book: “Gross output [GO] is the natural measure of the production sector, while net output [GDP] is appropriate as a measure of welfare. Both are required in a complete system of accounts.”\\nGO also dispels the popular Keynesian myth that consumer spending is the driver of economic growth. For example, the New York Times recently warned: “With personal consumption accounting for nearly 70 percent of all economic activity .\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0the administration will be hard pressed to lift growth substantially if consumers remain cautious about opening their wallets.” But GDP is an incomplete measure of economic activity. It overlooks the value of all goods-in-process, which amounted to more than $14.7 trillion in 2017.\\nThe broader-based GO highlights the reality that business spending is actually substantially larger than consumption. Consumption is 69% of GDP but just 39% of GO, while business spending is 17% of GDP but 52% of GO. This model therefore better recognizes the vital contributions of entrepreneurship, capital investment and innovative technology. As Larry Kudlow, the new director of the National Economic Council, wrote in 2006: “It is business, not consumers, that is the heart of the economy. When businesses produce profitably, they create income-producing jobs and thus consumers spend. Capital formation is the key to worker productivity and consumer prosperity.”\\nThe first-quarter 2018 GO release won’t come until July 20, but BEA director Brian Moyer says the agency plans to release both GO and GDP at the same time within the next year or two.

Look at new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft for hints at underlying business investment trends.\\nU.S. jobless claims, out at 8:30 a.m. ET, are expected to remain historically low.\\nTOP STORIES\\nCHILLING EFFECT\\nSome Chinese businesses\\xa0are\\xa0canceling or slowing plans to invest in the American market\\xa0because of U.S. threats to restrict investment.\\xa0China’s Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng didn’t name any specific businesses, but said that reduced investment from Chinese companies could affect U.S. employment and economic growth. If imposed, the U.S. restrictions would open a new front in an escalating trade battle, Liyan Qi reports. Mr. Gao said said Beijing is prepared to respond if the U.S. goes ahead with its plan. “We are sticking to our bottom-line thinking and are prepared to take action.”\\nSMALL TARGET\\nIn the U.S., some businesses are already feeling the\\xa0effects of the U.S.-China trade spat. Exports from small U.S. businesses to China have nearly tripled in the past 15 years, in line with the broader trend in bilateral trade. China’s latest tariffs target a wide swath of small businesses found among President Donald Trump’s support base in the U.S. Farm Belt, including growers of soybeans, sorghum and live hogs, as well as potentially bigger exporters such as aircraft manufacturers.\\nROOT OF THE PROBLEM\\nHere\\'s one example: Ginseng is a tiny sliver of the trade between the world’s two largest economies, making up about 0.02% of total U.S. exports to China. But effective April 2, the U.S.-grown root was slapped with a 15% tariff that Beijing imposed on U.S. agricultural commodities, part of the tit-for-tat exchange of tariffs that together potentially cover at least $200 billion in goods. That levy threatens to price American ginseng out of Chinese markets altogether, Chuin-Wei Yap reports. That may not seem like a big deal, but it’s potentially devastating to Paul Hsu and other U.S. farmers around Wausau, Wisc. The root has become a mainstay of this flat, fertile region over the past century—and an emblem of how globalization became embedded throughout the U.S. economy. “Nobody wins trade wars,” Mr. Hsu said.\\nPREPARE TO PAY MORE FOR YOUR NEXT TV\\nU.S. consumers also could feel the sting of tariffs. The Trump administration’s proposed tariffs on Chinese imports include a 25% levy on TVs and related components. A report commissioned by two trade associations says the levy could push up television prices in the U.S. by 4% overall, and by 23% for those from China. It isn’t clear whether manufacturers or retailers would shoulder the added costs or pass them along to consumers, Andrew Tangel reports. “The uncertainty level is extraordinarily high,” said Gary Shapiro, chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association. The report, based on trade data and an analysis of demand, suggested U.S. consumers could pare TV purchases by 8%, in terms of dollars spent, if the tariffs lead to higher prices.\\nHOT HOT HOT!\\nDeep into an economic boom with asset prices near records is when you’d expect the U.S. financial system’s guardians to tamp down risk-taking. Instead, federal regulators and legislators are doing the opposite—watering down, narrowing or declining to enforce rules passed after the financial crisis, Greg Ip writes. The changes are modest and don’t foreshadow a crisis any time soon. But the timing is definitely awkward. They will stimulate lending and risk-taking at a time when the industry is lowering its own standards amid a near-record economic expansion. Much as this year’s tax cut may overheat an economy already near full employment, the deregulatory push could aggravate excesses that come back to haunt the economy in its next downturn.\\nMS. MERKEL GOES TO WASHINGTON\\nAfter the razzmatazz of French President Emmanuel Macron’s state visit, Angela Merkel’s meeting with President Trump Friday is likely to be an altogether more businesslike affair, Simon Nixon writes. Whereas the U.S. president has forged an improbable bromance with his French counterpart, his relationship with the German chancellor is more strained. Mr. Trump has in the past been highly critical of Ms. Merkel’s policies. With Mr. Trump yet to decide whether to make the European Union’s current temporary exemption from tariffs on imported metals permanent before it expires on May 1, Ms. Merkel can expect the EU’s allegedly unfair trade practices to be firmly on the agenda.\\nCHARTS OF THE DAY: START ME UP\\nAmerica\\'s startup scene just ain\\'t what it used to be. During the latest economic expansion, new establishments have accounted for a little more than 11% of all new private-sector jobs created in the U.S. During the 1990s, the figure was 15%. Those few percentage points are the equivalent of hundreds of thousands of jobs per quarter. The startup slowdown also suggests a loss of dynamism across the broader U.S. economy, with Americans either less willing or less able to launch a new venture, and a decline in the kind of churn that leads to greater opportunity for workers and rising productivity.\\nIn fact, new establishments accounted for more jobs during parts of the recession than they do now.\\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\\n\"A commercial war opposing allies is not consistent with our mission, with our history, with our current commitments for the global security. At the end of the day, it will destroy jobs, increase prices and the middle class will have to pay for it.\" - French President Emmanuel Macron in a joint address to the U.S. Congress\\nTWEET OF THE DAY\\nI’m going to need one of you young people to explain to me just what in the hell is going on right now.\\n— John Dingell (@JohnDingell) April 25, 2018\\nWHAT ELSE WE\\'RE READING\\nDonald Trump is right. \"It is not every day you will read those words in the Financial Times, but the US president is correct when he says China does not play by the same trade and investment rules as the west,\" The Financial Times writes. But, and there\\'s always a but in the FT, he has to be careful not to alienate potential allies in his tussle with Beijing. Notably, that includes German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is visiting the White House on Friday.\\nMarried, banking separately. The Atlantic\\'s Caroline Kitchener chronicles a developing phenomenon of young married couples keeping separate finances. \"When I asked several married Millennial couples why they decided to keep their finances fully or partially separate, one reason came up more than any other: A joint bank account seemed to blur each individual’s financial contributions at a time when women are earning more than they used to.\"\\nSix or eight years ago, stories about rare-earth shortages and China\\'s dominance of the rare-earth industry were all the rage. The Cato Institute\\'s HumanProgress.org site chronicles the response: Companies found ways to use smaller amounts of the elements, others made do without them, and firms around the world raised money for new mining projects, ramped up existing plant capacities and accelerated plans to recycle rare earths. The result? No more shortage. \"The broader lesson from the rare earths episode is this: human beings are intelligent animals who innovate their way out of shortages, real and imagined.\"\\nUP NEXT: FRIDAY\\nThe Bank of Japan releases its statement on monetary policy and outlook for economic activity.\\nU.S. gross domestic product for the first quarter of the year is expected to advance at a 1.8% pace, a marked slowdown from the fourth quarter’s 2.9% gain.\\nThe U.S. employment cost index for the first quarter is expected to rise 0.7%, roughly in line with the fourth quarter\\'s 0.6% increase.\\nThe University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for April is expected to hold steady at 97.8, reflecting a broadly upbeat outlook.\\nPresident Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel\\xa0meet at the White House.

A report commissioned by two trade associations says the levy could push up television prices in the U.S. by 4% overall, and by 23% for those from China. It isn’t clear whether manufacturers or retailers would shoulder the added costs or pass them along to consumers, Andrew Tangel reports. “The uncertainty level is extraordinarily high,” said Gary Shapiro, chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association. The report, based on trade data and an analysis of demand, suggested U.S. consumers could pare TV purchases by 8%, in terms of dollars spent, if the tariffs lead to higher prices.\\nHOT HOT HOT!\\nDeep into an economic boom with asset prices near records is when you’d expect the U.S. financial system’s guardians to tamp down risk-taking. Instead, federal regulators and legislators are doing the opposite—watering down, narrowing or declining to enforce rules passed after the financial crisis, Greg Ip writes. The changes are modest and don’t foreshadow a crisis any time soon. But the timing is definitely awkward. They will stimulate lending and risk-taking at a time when the industry is lowering its own standards amid a near-record economic expansion. Much as this year’s tax cut may overheat an economy already near full employment, the deregulatory push could aggravate excesses that come back to haunt the economy in its next downturn.\\nMS. MERKEL GOES TO WASHINGTON\\nAfter the razzmatazz of French President Emmanuel Macron’s state visit, Angela Merkel’s meeting with President Trump Friday is likely to be an altogether more businesslike affair, Simon Nixon writes. Whereas the U.S. president has forged an improbable bromance with his French counterpart, his relationship with the German chancellor is more strained. Mr. Trump has in the past been highly critical of Ms. Merkel’s policies. With Mr. Trump yet to decide whether to make the European Union’s current temporary exemption from tariffs on imported metals permanent before it expires on May 1, Ms. Merkel can expect the EU’s allegedly unfair trade practices to be firmly on the agenda.\\nCHARTS OF THE DAY: START ME UP\\nAmerica\\'s startup scene just ain\\'t what it used to be. During the latest economic expansion, new establishments have accounted for a little more than 11% of all new private-sector jobs created in the U.S. During the 1990s, the figure was 15%. Those few percentage points are the equivalent of hundreds of thousands of jobs per quarter. The startup slowdown also suggests a loss of dynamism across the broader U.S. economy, with Americans either less willing or less able to launch a new venture, and a decline in the kind of churn that leads to greater opportunity for workers and rising productivity.\\nIn fact, new establishments accounted for more jobs during parts of the recession than they do now.\\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\\n\"A commercial war opposing allies is not consistent with our mission, with our history, with our current commitments for the global security.

       "   'article_text': 'The U.S. economy entered 2018 with stronger momentum than earlier thought, though corporate profits weakened at the end of 2017 against a backdrop of significant changes to the tax code.\\nGross domestic product, a broad measure of the goods and services produced across the U.S., rose at a 2.9% annual rate in the fourth quarter, adjusted for seasonality and inflation, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.\\nThat exceeded economists’ expectations and was up from a previous estimate of 2.5% growth, and only a little slower than the third quarter’s 3.2% growth and 3.1% growth in the second quarter. Consumer spending was revised higher for the fourth quarter, and private inventories exerted a smaller drag on growth than earlier thought.\\nOverall growth in the almost-finished first quarter is shaping up on the softer side; forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers on Wednesday projected a 1.8% growth rate for GDP in the first three months of the year.\\nStill, total output expanded 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with a year earlier, and many economists expect another strong year in 2018—aided by tax cuts, government spending, rising incomes, low unemployment and healthy growth overseas.\\n“The bottom line is that the U.S. economy remains on a solid footing,” said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, in a note.\\nWednesday’s report also contained the government’s first broad estimate of profits at U.S. companies in the fourth quarter. After-tax corporate profits, without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, fell 9.6% from the prior quarter and were down 6.0% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier.\\nCorporate profits weakened in 2015 as the U.S. energy industry was squeezed by plunging oil prices, but earnings have picked up over the past two years.\\nThe weak reading for the final months of 2017 may have reflected one-time effects of the wide-reaching tax legislation enacted in December. The Commerce Department said several provisions took effect in the fourth quarter—changes to the expensing of bonus depreciation and a one-time repatriation tax on foreign earnings.\\n“I would certainly peg it to that,” said Christine Short, senior vice president at analytics firm Estimize.\\nAmong other things, the tax legislation enacted in December slashed the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% starting Jan. 1. It scrambled fourth-quarter earnings at some large public companies due to various one-time effects, and may have created an incentive for some firms to shift earnings and expenses between late 2017 and early 2018. It could take several quarters for tax-related noise to fade from the profits data.\\nMs. Short said business earnings are benefiting from solid economic growth.\\n“The underlying trend for 2018 is still very good,” she said.\\nConsumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of total economic output. Wednesday’s report said personal-consumption expenditures rose at a 4.0% annual rate in the fourth quarter, revised up from a previous estimate of 3.8% growth and the strongest quarterly reading in three years.\\nYear-end spending was boosted by robust outlays on durable goods as many Americans replaced motor vehicles and other items damaged by several powerful late-summer hurricanes.\\nBusiness investment remained solid in the fourth quarter, with fixed nonresidential investment rising at a 6.8% annual rate. Capital expenditures were led by 11.6% growth for spending on equipment.\\nThe housing sector was a tailwind for growth in late 2017 as residential investment rose at a 12.8% annual pace. Government expenditures were up at a 3.0% annual rate in the fourth quarter, including a 5.5% growth rate for federal spending on national defense.\\nNet exports subtracted 1.16 percentage points from the quarter’s 2.9% GDP growth rate, and inventories subtracted 0.53 percentage point. Both categories tend to be volatile from quarter to quarter.\\nWrite to Ben Leubsdorf at ben.leubsdorf@wsj.com\\n'}),\n",

       "   'article_text': 'The economy has often appeared weaker than it is at the beginning of the year because of how the government measures growth. But after years of grumbling from financial heavyweights, officials say they have have solved the problem.\\nFirst-quarter gross domestic product growth from 2012 through 2017 has averaged an annual rate of 2.1%, according to fresh data the Bureau of Economic Analysis released Friday in a periodic revision. That is substantially higher than the previous 1.6% average, which made it the weakest of the four quarters. Changes to seasonal adjustment typically increase growth in some quarters at the expense of others with no impact on the year as a whole. That effect, along with other revisions, resulted in the fourth quarter now clocking the slowest average growth at 1.7%.\\nWhen not seasonally adjusted, economic growth is typically slower in the first three months of a year because of harsher weather and other regular spending patterns. The government attempts to adjust for this to give a better sense of underlying economic activity.\\nBEA had taken multiple steps to address so-called “residual seasonality” in its data that made growth at the start of each year appear misleadingly sluggish.\\nThose initial attempts to fix the issue helped, but data testing by different analysts revealed first-quarter growth still appeared weaker, with multiple components of GDP, including national defense spending, continuing to skew the numbers.\\nAfter the bureau began seasonally adjusting some underlying data that hadn’t previously been touched, along with other tweaks, the seasonality appears to have all but disappeared from GDP data.\\n“Based on what we have done and our tests, we are not showing signs of residual seasonality,” said Erich Strassner, associate director of BEA’s National Economic Accounts division.\\nMr. Strassner acknowledged they would need to continue testing the data to see if the pattern arises again.\\nOther key takeaways:\\nEconomic growth at the end of 2017 was significantly slower than the government originally published. BEA said GDP growth in the third and fourth quarter was 2.8% and 2.3%, respectively, down from the 3.2% and 2.9% originally reported for the two quarters. Overall growth for 2017 was revised down because of weaker consumer spending and exports and stronger imports, the latter of which subtracts from economic growth in the government’s calculation.\\nThe final two quarters of last year were initially a part of a strong three-quarter stretch of growth President Donald Trump’s administration and other economists were touting as the start of a new, robust growth trend in the economy.\\nOver the past decade, average GDP growth was slightly better than previously thought, with growth between 2007 and 2017 averaging 1.5%, above the previous 1.4% average. Investment was higher than data initially suggested, which would have boosted growth in the last decade even more, but the U.S. bought more foreign-made goods, which partially offset the ramped-up investment.\\nThe government revised its investment measure up from 2007 to 2017 because it found companies had made expensive cloud-computing investments, but they were buried deeper in the data, classified in different miscellaneous categories. BEA also reworked how it calculated research and development spending on original production of software.\\nThe economy has experienced a bout of puzzlingly low productivity growth, much to the consternation of economists. Business investment in new machinery and software helps companies increase the efficiency of its operations and employees. Some analysts have argued widespread technology investment isn’t reaching all industries fast enough, which is likely contributing to the slower productivity growth in the U.S. Friday’s revisions could suggest companies were investing more than economists are currently aware of.\\nThe average personal saving rate in the last five years was revised up to 7.0 from 5.0, but it wasn’t entirely because Americans saved more of their paychecks than thought. Sole-proprietor and partnership income from 2012 to 2017 was significantly higher than originally published because of misreporting on income-tax forms. Spending, however, wasn’t revised up along with the increased income, which is why the saving rate moved higher.\\nRELATED\\nU.S. Economy Grew At 4.1% Rate in Second Quarter\\xa0\\nDespite Attempts to Fix the Data, First-Quarter GDP May Still Mislead (April 27, 2018)\\nWhy First-Quarter Growth Is Often Weak (Apr 25, 2017)\\n'}),\n",

That would mark one of the strongest quarters in this nine year-old expansion.

U.S. consumers have been broadly upbeat amid strong job creation and economic growth.\\nTOP STORIES\\nSMOOTH OPERATOR\\nFriday’s GDP report has a little something extra: a five-year comprehensive benchmark revision. Commerce Department economists and analysts incorporate more reliable source data and improve their methodology, often resulting in more accurate figures and small adjustments to quarterly numbers. There’s not typically any major shift in our understanding of the economy. One thing to watch this time: changes to the seasonal adjustment process. Commerce acknowledges it has a problem smoothing its data—with proper seasonal adjustment the first quarter should not regularly come in\\xa0much weaker than other quarters. It’s trying to fix that to better reveal underlying economic trends. That could mean upward revisions for first quarters, downward revisions for other quarters, and the big picture just about the same.\\nNOT-SO-GREAT EXPECTATIONS\\nU.S. consumers have been expecting annual inflation of between 2.5% and 3% for most of the past eight years, according to a monthly University of Michigan survey. That held even during 2015, when annual inflation was trending near zero. Now, the consumer-price index is approaching 3%. Is that causing\\xa0households to recalculate? Nope. They\\'re sticking to their guns—expecting 2.9% inflation in the next year, according to a July survey. Well-anchored inflation expectations allowed Federal Reserve policy makers to look beyond temporary factors holding down price increases in the recent past. Will those same expectations give the Fed leeway if inflation overshoots its target? The University of Michigan updates\\xa0its numbers Friday at 10 a.m. ET. - Eric Morath\\nTACTICAL SHIFT ON TRADE\\nThe Trump administration opted for cooperation over confrontation in its latest round with the European Union. But Republicans pushed the administration to find similar solutions on other fronts: Trump advisers got an earful from angry lawmakers on Capitol Hill, who blasted the administration’s approach, criticized the Europe pact as weak, demanded faster relief for ailing constituents and pledged to ramp up efforts to tie Mr. Trump’s hands in shaping trade policy going forward, Siobhan Hughes and Jacob M. Schlesinger report.\\nMr. Trump’s aides said his policy has led to\\xa0newly active negotiations from North America to Asia to Africa. They said that has raised the prospect of new trade gains amid the pain already felt in the U.S. from higher import prices and from exports lost due to retaliation by trading partners.\\nCHINA\\'S SLOWING ECONOMY\\nThe Trump administration sees China as America\\'s\\xa0biggest economic threat. But the Asian nation is having troubles of its own. China is moving faster than expected to inject money into the economy, a sign that the government is becoming more worried about slowing growth as trade tensions are on the rise. The country’s cabinet this week encouraged local governments to quickly tap the bond market. The central bank lent more than 500 billion yuan ($74 billion) to banks, a push to get them to lend and the largest one-time amount since such injections started in 2014. The recent measures are directed at an economy that has seen growth gradually slow for eight years, Chao Deng reports.\\nFRANCE\\'S SLOWING ECONOMY\\nFrance may have won the World Cup. But its economy didn\\'t win the second quarter. GDP grew an anemic 0.2% on a quarterly basis between April and June. That works out to 0.6% annualized growth (which is how the U.S. reports GDP), according to J.P. Morgan . In contrast, the U.S. is expected to post 4.4%. One of the key factors in France: a drop in household consumption driven in part by transit strikes. Trade also subtracted from growth. J.P. Morgan says the French data \"suggests a bit of downside risk\" to eurozone GDP, which is due Tuesday. The bank had called for 2% annualized growth, but now it could come in a bit below that. - Brian Blackstone\\nCHART OF THE DAY: FRIEND REQUEST\\nFacebook suffered the biggest-ever one-day loss in market value for a U.S.-listed company after it warned about slowing growth. Facebook’s loss in market value Thursday is larger than 457 of the 500 companies in the S&P 500.\\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\\nTrade wars encourage predatory state behaviour. They lead to higher taxes, reduce consumer choice and hamper economic freedom, and they are not easy to win. The result is trade controlled by governments, instead of companies and consumers making decisions in their own interests. -\\xa0EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström, writing in The Financial Times\\nTWEET\\xa0OF THE DAY\\nThe journalism exercise of putting large numbers in perspective, @facebook edition: Yesterday\\'s $119B loss in market value exceeds 1) the individual market caps of 91% of S&P 500 companies; 2) the combined cap of the bottom 20 S&P cos; 3) the individual GDPs of Sudan and Ukraine\\n— Ben St. Clair (@BenStClair1) July 27, 2018\\nWHAT ELSE WE\\'RE READING\\nChina appeared caught off guard by President Trump’s aggressive trade tactics. \"Sources and observers told the South China Morning Post that the problem is policies introduced by Beijing–driven by a need to consolidate the party’s power–that have discouraged policy advisers from having in-depth discussions with their US counterparts that would help them to understand the latest thinking in Washington, or from speaking their minds. That has left Beijing without a comprehensive strategy to deal with the Trump administration, at least on the trade front, at a time of heightened tension and rivalry,\" Wendy Wu and Kristin Huang write in the Hong Kong newspaper.\\nThe U.S. is still a magnet for scientific talent. \"[W]e estimate students’ location preferences using a hypothetical choice method: we ask respondents to choose between two postdoc job offers, where one offer is in the U.S. and one is abroad.

For China’s official GDP data, the rule is the opposite: Ignore the implausibly smooth signal and search for the noise.\\nChina’s 2017 headline growth came out at 6.9%, a touch higher than 2016’s 6.7%. A last-minute delay in releasing the data Thursday won’t do much to boost investors’ confidence in its accuracy, following a string of admissions this month on padded data from the hardscrabble industrial north.\\nLuckily, there is plenty of more-reliable data—like freight volumes, lending, real-estate investment, and purchasing managers’ employment data—and they all tell a remarkably similar story: China experienced a sharp slowdown in late 2014 followed by a rapid rebound starting in early 2016 and gaining pace for most of last year.\\nThe question is, What happens next?\\nMost of the reliable indicators tied to industry show growth peaking in mid or late 2017, and now trending gradually down. Since income growth tends to follow corporate profits in China, it’s a good bet consumption will initially hold up in 2018, helping offset the slowdown in investment.\\nThere are two big near-term risks.\\nThe first is a rise in trade tensions. Exports matter less to China than they used to, but they were key to its hitting the sweet spot—rising growth and falling indebtedness—last year. A hard knock from across the Pacific would make that hard to repeat—and damage income growth too—tempting Chinese leaders to ramp up lending again. Commodities would benefit, but China’s long-term prospects would dim.\\nThe second risk is that credit stops flowing. Despite all the deleveraging talk, the annual rate of broad credit growth in China was still a healthy 13% in December, down only a bit from its recent peak of 17% in April 2016.\\nRegulatory actions in January suggest the next target in the campaign against leverage could be a type of shadow financing called “entrusted” company-to-company loans, which would put businesses in a tough spot.\\nEverything went right for Chinese growth in 2017. A disaster this year looks unlikely, but slower credit growth and rising trade tensions could test the current near-euphoric sentiment—and certain asset classes like commodities and bubbly industrial equities.\\nWrite to Nathaniel Taplin at nathaniel.taplin@wsj.com\\n'}),\n",

In its original report, the agency estimated GDP—the value of all goods and services produced in the U.S.—rose at a seasonally and inflation-adjusted annual rate of 3.5% from July through September. Strong consumer spending powered economic growth over this period, helping to offset weak business investment and a drop in U.S. exports.

Purchases of newly built single-family homes—a relatively narrow slice of all U.S. home sales—fell 5.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 553,000 in September.

Economists surveyed by the Journal forecast new-home sales clocked in at an annual rate of 575,000 in October.\\nThe Commerce Department releases personal-income, consumer spending and inflation figures for October. Personal income, reflecting Americans’ pretax earnings from salaries and investments, edged up 0.2% in September, while consumer spending increased a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in September from the prior month.

Economists surveyed by the Journal forecast personal-income grew 0.4% in October; they forecast core PCE prices increased 1.9% from a year earlier.\\nChina releases its official gauge of factory activity for November.

Some analysts in recent weeks have cut their full-year growth forecasts to as low as 2%, from 3%.\\nBrazil’s central bank releases April budget figures. Overspending has failed to pump up the economy and has raised concerns ahead of a heated general election in October. As of March, the shortfall stood at 7% of GDP.\\nThe U.S. Commerce Department releases its second estimate of first-quarter economic growth. The initial GDP release showed the economy lost momentum at the beginning of 2018, coming in at a 2.3% annualized rate. Economists are expecting the second estimate to remain at 2.3%.\\nTHURSDAY: China releases the official gauge of factory activity for May (release time is Wednesday night in the U.S.). Economists expect the manufacturing purchasing managers index to hold steady at 51.4 in May. Production likely remained robust, but new orders probably have been disrupted by ongoing trade tensions between China and the U.S., they say.\\nAfter a disappointingly weak start to the year for the eurozone economy, the European Central Bank is expected to finally receive some encouraging news with the release of inflation figures for May. Economists expect to see a rise in the annual rate of inflation to 1.6%, from 1.2% in April, moving the metric closer to the ECB’s target of just under 2%. Rising energy prices are likely to have pushed the rate higher, but a measure of core inflation that excludes that factor is expected to record a more modest increase, to 1% from 0.7% in April.\\nFRIDAY: The U.S. Labor Department publishes the May jobs report. In April, the unemployment ratefell to 3.9%, the lowest level since 2000, as the economy added a weaker-than-expected 164,000 jobs. Economists expect the unemployment rate to stabilize at 3.9% in May, with about 188,000 jobs likely added in the month.\\n'}),\n",

      "article_text :  Analysts watching bumpy economic data in the U.S. and Europe often focus on the signal—the long-term trend—and ignore the noise. For China’s official GDP data, the rule is the opposite: Ignore the implausibly smooth signal and search for the noise.\n",
      "China’s 2017 headline growth came out at 6.9%, a touch higher than 2016’s 6.7%. A last-minute delay in releasing the data Thursday won’t do much to boost investors’ confidence in its accuracy, following a string of admissions this month on padded data from the hardscrabble industrial north.\n",
      "Luckily, there is plenty of more-reliable data—like freight volumes, lending, real-estate investment, and purchasing managers’ employment data—and they all tell a remarkably similar story: China experienced a sharp slowdown in late 2014 followed by a rapid rebound starting in early 2016 and gaining pace for most of last year.\n",
      "The question is, What happens next?\n",
      "Most of the reliable indicators tied to industry show growth peaking in mid or late 2017, and now trending gradually down. Since income growth tends to follow corporate profits in China, it’s a good bet consumption will initially hold up in 2018, helping offset the slowdown in investment.\n",
      "There are two big near-term risks.\n",
      "The first is a rise in trade tensions. Exports matter less to China than they used to, but they were key to its hitting the sweet spot—rising growth and falling indebtedness—last year. A hard knock from across the Pacific would make that hard to repeat—and damage income growth too—tempting Chinese leaders to ramp up lending again. Commodities would benefit, but China’s long-term prospects would dim.\n",
      "The second risk is that credit stops flowing. Despite all the deleveraging talk, the annual rate of broad credit growth in China was still a healthy 13% in December, down only a bit from its recent peak of 17% in April 2016.\n",
      "Regulatory actions in January suggest the next target in the campaign against leverage could be a type of shadow financing called “entrusted” company-to-company loans, which would put businesses in a tough spot.\n",
      "Everything went right for Chinese growth in 2017. A disaster this year looks unlikely, but slower credit growth and rising trade tensions could test the current near-euphoric sentiment—and certain asset classes like commodities and bubbly industrial equities.\n",

With the synchronized global growth upturn in the rearview mirror, the downturn is no longer a forecast, but is now a fact,” Lakshman Achuthan and Anirvan Banerji write for Bloomberg View. “Quarter-over-quarter annualized gross domestic product growth rates in the three largest advanced economies—the U.S., the euro zone, and Japan—have turned down. In all three, GDP growth peaked in the second or third quarter of 2017, and fell in the fourth quarter. This is what the start of a synchronized global growth downswing looks like…The current situation is reminiscent of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner cartoons. Intent of chasing his nemesis, the coyote almost always misses a sharp turn in the road, running right over a cliff edge. He realizes too late that he’s in midair, and plunges into the chasm below. That’s the crux of the problem for international economies and markets in danger of being blindsided by the cyclical downturn in global growth.”\n",

      "Gross domestic product, a broad measure of the goods and services produced across the U.S., rose at a 2.9% annual rate in the fourth quarter, adjusted for seasonality and inflation, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.\n",
      "That exceeded economists’ expectations and was up from a previous estimate of 2.5% growth, and only a little slower than the third quarter’s 3.2% growth and 3.1% growth in the second quarter. Consumer spending was revised higher for the fourth quarter, and private inventories exerted a smaller drag on growth than earlier thought.\n",
      "Overall growth in the almost-finished first quarter is shaping up on the softer side; forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers on Wednesday projected a 1.8% growth rate for GDP in the first three months of the year.\n",
      "Still, total output expanded 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with a year earlier, and many economists expect another strong year in 2018—aided by tax cuts, government spending, rising incomes, low unemployment and healthy growth overseas.\n",
      "“The bottom line is that the U.S. economy remains on a solid footing,” said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, in a note.\n",
      "Wednesday’s report also contained the government’s first broad estimate of profits at U.S. companies in the fourth quarter. After-tax corporate profits, without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, fell 9.6% from the prior quarter and were down 6.0% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier.\n",
      "Corporate profits weakened in 2015 as the U.S. energy industry was squeezed by plunging oil prices, but earnings have picked up over the past two years.\n",
      "The weak reading for the final months of 2017 may have reflected one-time effects of the wide-reaching tax legislation enacted in December. The Commerce Department said several provisions took effect in the fourth quarter—changes to the expensing of bonus depreciation and a one-time repatriation tax on foreign earnings.\n",
      "“I would certainly peg it to that,” said Christine Short, senior vice president at analytics firm Estimize.\n",
      "Among other things, the tax legislation enacted in December slashed the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% starting Jan. 1. It scrambled fourth-quarter earnings at some large public companies due to various one-time effects, and may have created an incentive for some firms to shift earnings and expenses between late 2017 and early 2018. It could take several quarters for tax-related noise to fade from the profits data.\n",
      "Ms. Short said business earnings are benefiting from solid economic growth.\n",
      "“The underlying trend for 2018 is still very good,” she said.\n",
      "Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of total economic output. Wednesday’s report said personal-consumption expenditures rose at a 4.0% annual rate in the fourth quarter, revised up from a previous estimate of 3.8% growth and the strongest quarterly reading in three years.\n",

According to the Atlanta Fed consensus tracker, economists are predicting gross domestic product to have risen at a meager 2% annual rate. But a powerful behind-the-scenes indicator suggests the real rate may turn out to be significantly higher.\n",
      "“Gross output,” or GO, reflects the full value of the supply chain—the business-to-business spending that moves all goods and services toward the final retail market. Based on my work and research by David Ranson, chief economist at HCWE & Co., changes in the supply chain are a strong leading indicator of the next quarter’s GDP.\n",
      "The supply chain, which the BEA calls “intermediate inputs,” took off in the fourth quarter of 2017, growing at a 7.5% annualized rate. That’s more than double the rate of real GDP growth and the fastest pace since before the Great Recession. Real GO, which includes both GDP and the supply chain, rose at a 4.7% rate. The growth was broad-based, with strong numbers in mining, manufacturing, utilities and construction. The fourth quarter 2017 GDP growth rate of 2.9% did not reflect the dramatic increases in intermediate outputs because GDP by definition measures only spending at the end of the economic chain.\n",
      "The GO model is more in keeping with the Conference Board’s list of 10 leading economic indicators, which are linked to manufacturing and capital markets. For three quarters in a row in 2017, GO accelerated, probably due to the anticipated tax breaks and deregulatory environment. The boom in intermediate business activity should translate into higher economic growth soon, barring international instability, trade wars, or tighter-than-expected monetary policy.\n",
      "As I noted in these pages in 2014, measuring gross output is a breakthrough in national income accounting. By reporting GO as well as GDP, the BEA has helped economists catch up with the accounting and finance professions. Public companies have long reported the top line (revenue) and the bottom line (profit) at the same time each quarter. For a national economy, GO corresponds to the top line (total activity) and GDP to the bottom line (final product). As the economists Dale Jorgenson, J. Steven Landefeld and William Nordhaus wrote in a 2006 book: “Gross output [GO] is the natural measure of the production sector, while net output [GDP] is appropriate as a measure of welfare. Both are required in a complete system of accounts.”\n",
      "GO also dispels the popular Keynesian myth that consumer spending is the driver of economic growth. For example, the New York Times recently warned: “With personal consumption accounting for nearly 70 percent of all economic activity . . . the administration will be hard pressed to lift growth substantially if consumers remain cautious about opening their wallets.” But GDP is an incomplete measure of economic activity. It overlooks the value of all goods-in-process, which amounted to more than $14.7 trillion in 2017.\n",
      "The broader-based GO highlights the reality that business spending is actually substantially larger than consumption. Consumption is 69% of GDP but just 39% of GO, while business spending is 17% of GDP but 52% of GO. This model therefore better recognizes the vital contributions of entrepreneurship, capital investment and innovative technology. As Larry Kudlow, the new director of the National Economic Council, wrote in 2006: “It is business, not consumers, that is the heart of the economy. When businesses produce profitably, they create income-producing jobs and thus consumers spend. Capital formation is the key to worker productivity and consumer prosperity.”\n",
      "The first-quarter 2018 GO release won’t come until July 20, but BEA director Brian Moyer says the agency plans to release both GO and GDP at the same time within the next year or two. Hopefully by then the media will catch on to this advance in supply-side national accounting and leading indicator of robust economic performance.\n",

      "The U.S. economy grew at a 1.8% pace in the first quarter, according to forecasts, a marked slowdown from the 3.1% average of the prior three quarters. Don't worry. It's not out of whack with the first quarter of 2017 (1.2%) or 2016 (0.6%). Since 2007, gross domestic product growth has averaged 0.2% in first quarters and 1.9% in all others. The Commerce Department tries to adjust for seasonal quirks (construction is down in the winter, retail sales jump at Christmas) and is making improvements to its calculations. But economists believe the agency is still missing something. \"If this is indeed the case, then the [Bureau of Economic Analysis's] estimates of first-quarter growth may be underestimating the true strength of the US economy,\" economists at Morgan Stanley said.\n",

      "Here's one example: Ginseng is a tiny sliver of the trade between the world’s two largest economies, making up about 0.02% of total U.S. exports to China. But effective April 2, the U.S.-grown root was slapped with a 15% tariff that Beijing imposed on U.S. agricultural commodities, part of the tit-for-tat exchange of tariffs that together potentially cover at least $200 billion in goods. That levy threatens to price American ginseng out of Chinese markets altogether, Chuin-Wei Yap reports. That may not seem like a big deal, but it’s potentially devastating to Paul Hsu and other U.S. farmers around Wausau, Wisc. The root has become a mainstay of this flat, fertile region over the past century—and an emblem of how globalization became embedded throughout the U.S. economy. “Nobody wins trade wars,” Mr. Hsu said.\n",

      "article_text :  If you’re looking for the most accurate view of economic growth, you won’t find it in the government’s top-line statistics. Last month the Bureau of Economic Analysis revised its estimate for the first quarter of 2018; the BEA now says gross domestic product grew 2%, annualized, down from the previous figure of 2.2%. This dramatically understates the economy’s actual performance. A better measure, factoring in statistics on incomes, shows growth steaming along at a much stronger 2.8%.\n",
      "Why the difference? In short, because the data aren’t perfect. Unlike the unemployment rate, which comes from a (relatively) straightforward survey, GDP is not measured directly. Instead, the BEA sums up economy-wide expenditures from dozens of data sources, covering consumption, investment, government spending, net exports and more.\n",
      "Last month’s figure was the BEA’s third estimate for the first quarter. Yet at this stage the statisticians have comprehensive data on only 38.5% of GDP. Most of the rest was inferred using direct or indirect indicators, such as by taking the number of housing starts as a proxy for dollars invested in new home construction. For 12% of GDP, the statisticians used “trend-based data,” which essentially amounts to extrapolation and guess work. To take a couple of specific examples, the BEA had a reasonably accurate measure of cars bought in the first quarter, but it had to guess how much financial services were purchased.\n",
      "Producing the most accurate statistics can be costly, complicated and fraught with these kinds of measurement problems. Despite the best efforts of the BEA’s excellent civil servants, the underlying data are noisy and incomplete, meaning that revisions to GDP growth estimates can be large and often confusing. The average absolute revision from 1993 through 2016 was 1.3 percentage point.\n",
      "Drawing on more data can cancel out some of this noise and produce a more accurate figure that requires smaller revisions. Specifically, the BEA separately gauges the size of the economy by adding up all the different sources of income, such as wages and profits. This figure is called gross domestic income, or GDI, and in the first quarter of 2018 it grew by an estimated 3.6%, annualized.\n",
      "Ultimately, GDI should be identical to GDP, since all money spent is money earned. But in practice the published estimates differ because the data are subject to different errors and reflect different guesses. Research shows that a simple average of GDP and GDI is a nearly optimal way to combine the two sets of information. For the first quarter it averages to 2.8% growth. That is the best predictor of what the government will eventually estimate for GDP after several years of revisions.\n",
      "The BEA’s statisticians already report this number, which they call “average of GDP and GDI,” but they bury it, and the financial press and analysts usually ignore it. The BEA should immediately start reporting this figure as its headline growth estimate, because it is the most accurate way to measure the economy. Until it does, serious analysts can help themselves by playing down the noisier GDP data and focusing on the average, which better captures the economic signal.\n",
      "With more time and resources, the BEA should integrate data from expenditures and incomes together into a single unified estimate, as many countries, including the United Kingdom and Canada, already do. When the BEA is filling in the blanks for the missing data on financial services, for example, it could choose numbers from both sources to create a combined best guess.\n",
      "The additional accuracy would be beneficial for businesses and policy makers planning for the future. But accuracy becomes even more important when the economy may be entering a recession. Since estimating GDP involves extrapolating past performance, it overstates growth when things turn sharply downward. As the economy entered a tailspin at the end of 2008, the original report for the fourth quarter had GDP growth at minus 3.8%. That was eventually revised to minus 8.2%.\n",
      "The BEA should fix the presentation of these data before the next major recession. An easy statistical change is all the Trump administration needs to MAGA: Measure American Growth Accurately.\n",

Instead, the BEA sums up economy-wide expenditures from dozens of data sources, covering consumption, investment, government spending, net exports and more.\n",
      "Last month’s figure was the BEA’s third estimate for the first quarter. Yet at this stage the statisticians have comprehensive data on only 38.5% of GDP. Most of the rest was inferred using direct or indirect indicators, such as by taking the number of housing starts as a proxy for dollars invested in new home construction. For 12% of GDP, the statisticians used “trend-based data,” which essentially amounts to extrapolation and guess work. To take a couple of specific examples, the BEA had a reasonably accurate measure of cars bought in the first quarter, but it had to guess how much financial services were purchased.\n",
      "Producing the most accurate statistics can be costly, complicated and fraught with these kinds of measurement problems. Despite the best efforts of the BEA’s excellent civil servants, the underlying data are noisy and incomplete, meaning that revisions to GDP growth estimates can be large and often confusing. The average absolute revision from 1993 through 2016 was 1.3 percentage point.\n",
      "Drawing on more data can cancel out some of this noise and produce a more accurate figure that requires smaller revisions. Specifically, the BEA separately gauges the size of the economy by adding up all the different sources of income, such as wages and profits. This figure is called gross domestic income, or GDI, and in the first quarter of 2018 it grew by an estimated 3.6%, annualized.\n",
      "Ultimately, GDI should be identical to GDP, since all money spent is money earned. But in practice the published estimates differ because the data are subject to different errors and reflect different guesses. Research shows that a simple average of GDP and GDI is a nearly optimal way to combine the two sets of information. For the first quarter it averages to 2.8% growth. That is the best predictor of what the government will eventually estimate for GDP after several years of revisions.\n",
      "The BEA’s statisticians already report this number, which they call “average of GDP and GDI,” but they bury it, and the financial press and analysts usually ignore it. The BEA should immediately start reporting this figure as its headline growth estimate, because it is the most accurate way to measure the economy. Until it does, serious analysts can help themselves by playing down the noisier GDP data and focusing on the average, which better captures the economic signal.\n",
      "With more time and resources, the BEA should integrate data from expenditures and incomes together into a single unified estimate, as many countries, including the United Kingdom and Canada, already do. When the BEA is filling in the blanks for the missing data on financial services, for example, it could choose numbers from both sources to create a combined best guess.\n",
      "The additional accuracy would be beneficial for businesses and policy makers planning for the future. But accuracy becomes even more important when the economy may be entering a recession. Since estimating GDP involves extrapolating past performance, it overstates growth when things turn sharply downward. As the economy entered a tailspin at the end of 2008, the original report for the fourth quarter had GDP growth at minus 3.8%. That was eventually revised to minus 8.2%.\n",
      "The BEA should fix the presentation of these data before the next major recession. An easy statistical change is all the Trump administration needs to MAGA: Measure American Growth Accurately.\n",

      "article_text :  The economy has often appeared weaker than it is at the beginning of the year because of how the government measures growth. But after years of grumbling from financial heavyweights, officials say they have have solved the problem.\n",
      "First-quarter gross domestic product growth from 2012 through 2017 has averaged an annual rate of 2.1%, according to fresh data the Bureau of Economic Analysis released Friday in a periodic revision. That is substantially higher than the previous 1.6% average, which made it the weakest of the four quarters. Changes to seasonal adjustment typically increase growth in some quarters at the expense of others with no impact on the year as a whole. That effect, along with other revisions, resulted in the fourth quarter now clocking the slowest average growth at 1.7%.\n",
      "When not seasonally adjusted, economic growth is typically slower in the first three months of a year because of harsher weather and other regular spending patterns. The government attempts to adjust for this to give a better sense of underlying economic activity.\n",
      "BEA had taken multiple steps to address so-called “residual seasonality” in its data that made growth at the start of each year appear misleadingly sluggish.\n",
      "Those initial attempts to fix the issue helped, but data testing by different analysts revealed first-quarter growth still appeared weaker, with multiple components of GDP, including national defense spending, continuing to skew the numbers.\n",
      "After the bureau began seasonally adjusting some underlying data that hadn’t previously been touched, along with other tweaks, the seasonality appears to have all but disappeared from GDP data.\n",
      "“Based on what we have done and our tests, we are not showing signs of residual seasonality,” said Erich Strassner, associate director of BEA’s National Economic Accounts division.\n",
      "Mr. Strassner acknowledged they would need to continue testing the data to see if the pattern arises again.\n",
      "Other key takeaways:\n",
      "Economic growth at the end of 2017 was significantly slower than the government originally published. BEA said GDP growth in the third and fourth quarter was 2.8% and 2.3%, respectively, down from the 3.2% and 2.9% originally reported for the two quarters. Overall growth for 2017 was revised down because of weaker consumer spending and exports and stronger imports, the latter of which subtracts from economic growth in the government’s calculation.\n",
      "The final two quarters of last year were initially a part of a strong three-quarter stretch of growth President Donald Trump’s administration and other economists were touting as the start of a new, robust growth trend in the economy.\n",
      "Over the past decade, average GDP growth was slightly better than previously thought, with growth between 2007 and 2017 averaging 1.5%, above the previous 1.4% average. Investment was higher than data initially suggested, which would have boosted growth in the last decade even more, but the U.S. bought more foreign-made goods, which partially offset the ramped-up investment.\n",
      "The government revised its investment measure up from 2007 to 2017 because it found companies had made expensive cloud-computing investments, but they were buried deeper in the data, classified in different miscellaneous categories. BEA also reworked how it calculated research and development spending on original production of software.\n",
      "The economy has experienced a bout of puzzlingly low productivity growth, much to the consternation of economists. Business investment in new machinery and software helps companies increase the efficiency of its operations and employees. Some analysts have argued widespread technology investment isn’t reaching all industries fast enough, which is likely contributing to the slower productivity growth in the U.S. Friday’s revisions could suggest companies were investing more than economists are currently aware of.\n",
      "The average personal saving rate in the last five years was revised up to 7.0 from 5.0, but it wasn’t entirely because Americans saved more of their paychecks than thought. Sole-proprietor and partnership income from 2012 to 2017 was significantly higher than originally published because of misreporting on income-tax forms. Spending, however, wasn’t revised up along with the increased income, which is why the saving rate moved higher.\n",

      "Economists expect the U.S. economy's output grew at a seasonally and inflation-adjusted annual rate of 4.4% in the second quarter. That would mark one of the strongest quarters in this nine year-old expansion. While consumer spending likely bounced back from a weak first quarter, economists think trade drastically skewed the second-quarter numbers to the upside due to companies stockpiling ahead of expected tariffs and a surge in U.S. soybean exports during the second quarter.

Commerce Department economists and analysts incorporate more reliable source data and improve their methodology, often resulting in more accurate figures and small adjustments to quarterly numbers. There’s not typically any major shift in our understanding of the economy. One thing to watch this time: changes to the seasonal adjustment process. Commerce acknowledges it has a problem smoothing its data—with proper seasonal adjustment the first quarter should not regularly come in much weaker than other quarters. It’s trying to fix that to better reveal underlying economic trends. That could mean upward revisions for first quarters, downward revisions for other quarters, and the big picture just about the same.\n",

They're sticking to their guns—expecting 2.9% inflation in the next year, according to a July survey.

The country’s cabinet this week encouraged local governments to quickly tap the bond market. The central bank lent more than 500 billion yuan ($74 billion) to banks, a push to get them to lend and the largest one-time amount since such injections started in 2014.

Exports of foods, feeds and beverages—a category that includes the soybeans China placed a 25% tariff on this month—rose at a 110% annual rate.

In its original report, the agency estimated GDP—the value of all goods and services produced in the U.S.—rose at a seasonally and inflation-adjusted annual rate of 3.5% from July through September.

      "India has recalculated its already recalculated historical economic figures, downgrading growth before Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power—and so making his numbers look better.\n",
      "Coming less than six months before national elections that will determine whether Mr. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party get another term, the change struck the opposition, led by the Indian National Congress party, as suspiciously self-serving.\n",
      "The “revised GDP numbers are a joke,” tweeted Parliament member P. Chidambaram, who served as finance minister in the previous Congress party government. “They are a bad joke.”\n",
      "The numbers aren’t politically motivated, the Central Statistics Office declared, saying they reflect the latest and best global practices for measuring gross domestic product. Current Finance Minister Arun Jaitley spoke up for the statisticians.\n",
      "“The CSO is a highly credible organization. It completely maintains an arm’s-length distance from the Finance Ministry,” he told local media in a televised interview. “This data is far more inclusive and far more reflective of the situation of the Indian economy.”\n",
      "Debate about Mr. Modi’s relative performance flared up in August with the initial report on the recalculation of GDP back to 1994.\n",
      "In 2015 a change to the base and components of GDP—calculated back only three years—greatly boosted the figures for India under Mr. Modi. The numbers released in August, by contrast, showed stronger growth under the previous government led by the Congress party than in any period under Mr. Modi.\n",
      "The opposition trumpeted them as proof of its superior stewardship. The government answered that there would be further tweaks.\n",

      "Some of the price increases reflected temporary factors, but others showed how demand for many goods and services is reviving a year after the coronavirus pandemic shut down large swaths of the economy, analysts said.\n",
      "The Labor Department reported Tuesday that its consumer-price index—which measures what consumers pay for everyday items including groceries, clothing, recreational activities and vehicles—jumped 2.6% in the year ended March, the biggest 12-month increase since August 2018, and rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in March from February.\n",
      "Nearly half the monthly increase was due to a 9.1% jump in gasoline prices, which have climbed partly due to production problems following severe winter storms, economists said.\n",
      "The so-called core CPI, which excludes the often-volatile categories of food and energy, climbed 1.6% over the prior year, and was up 0.3% in March from February.\n",
      "The CPI increased more sharply in March than in February, when it rose 1.7% on an annual basis and 0.4% from a month earlier. Core CPI in February was up 1.3% over the previous year, and 0.1% versus January.\n",
      "“One of the major things we’re seeing that marks a big change from recent years is that really for the first time in a decade you have a wide range of businesses with pricing power right now,” said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities. “After a year of closures, people are eager to get out and spend, and they have the means to do it,” she said. “We see a real awakening of the service economy in these numbers.”\n",
      "Services prices, excluding energy, rose 0.4% in March from February, the fastest monthly pace since July 2020, as the country’s recovery from the initial Covid-19 impact took off. Prices for hotels, car rentals, airfare and admission to sporting events were all up in March.\n",

      "Economists widely expect consumer prices to keep climbing in the months ahead after nearly a year of muted overall inflation as the Covid-19 pandemic damped consumer spending. Whether this rise proves transitory is one of the key questions for markets and the U.S. recovery over the next year or so, as the Biden administration, Congress and the Federal Reserve continue to provide financial support for the economy.\n",
      "Fed officials expect inflation to rise temporarily this year because of growing demand fueled by increased vaccination rates, decreasing restrictions on businesses, trillions of dollars in federal pandemic-relief programs and ample consumer savings.\n",
      "More than a third of Americans have now received at least one Covid-19 vaccine shot, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Congress last month approved another $1.9 trillion in fiscal support.\n",
      "Economists forecast real U.S. gross domestic product will grow at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.1% in the second quarter, according to a recent Wall Street Journal survey, putting the U.S. economy on track for its best performance since the early 1980s.\n",
      "The annual inflation measurements in coming months will be boosted as well by comparisons with the figures from last year. Prices dropped steeply in 2020 because of collapsing demand for many goods and services—including air travel, hotels and apparel—as the pandemic hit the economy. Many businesses closed and consumers hunkered down at home.\n",
      "Gasoline prices, for instance, were up 22% in March compared with a year earlier. Fuel oil prices were 20% higher.\n",
      "These so-called base effects will boost the 12-month CPI readings further in April and May, and start diminishing in June, said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. “But prices will still be supported by the economy reopening, especially the service sector, which will unleash demand.”\n",
      "Meanwhile, rising production costs are already pushing up prices of many household goods. Kimberly-Clark Corp., the maker of Huggies diapers and Scott paper products, said last week that it will start raising prices on many of its North America consumer products to help defray higher raw-material costs. A number of other consumer-products companies—including Cheerios maker General Mills Inc., Skippy peanut-butter maker Hormel Foods Corp. and pet-snacks maker J.M. Smucker Co.—have indicated similar plans.\n",
      "Beyond consumer items, many producers of industrial goods and components are raising prices too. For example, two big U.S. manufacturers of heating and cooling equipment have announced price increases. Lennox International Inc. said this week it would raise prices by about 6% to 9% starting June 1 for commercial and residential orders. Trane Technologies PLC recently increased prices by up to 7.5% on some products in its commercial HVAC business. In early March, Trane boosted prices on some residential equipment by up to 6%.\n",
      "“Customers never like higher prices, of course, but they are busy and seeing increases throughout the supply chain,” said Holden Lewis, the chief financial officer of Fastenal Co., a distributor of fasteners, tools and other industrial supplies.\n",
      "The economists surveyed expect this year’s inflation pickup to be transitory. They projected on average that annual inflation, measured by the CPI, will climb to 3% in June, which would be the highest rate since 2012, before falling to 2.6% by December.\n",
      "Fed officials also expect the inflation surge to pass. Their 2% inflation target is based on a different measure: the price index of personal-consumption expenditures, which tends to run a bit below the CPI. Their latest projections show annual PCE inflation rising from 1.6% in February to 2.4% by the fourth quarter, and receding to 2% in 2022.\n",
      "Inflation has remained below 2% for most of the past decade, and Fed officials say they want to see it run above that level for some time to make up for the shortfall.\n",
      "Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said Monday he expects that inflation will rise this year but not in a worrisome way. “As long as it’s in the 2-2.5% range, which I think is highly likely over the next two years, I would not be particularly concerned,” he said in an interview with the Journal.\n",
      "The Fed has said it would start to raise interest rates from near zero when PCE inflation reaches 2% and is headed higher, and when full employment has been achieved. Officials last month projected that point wouldn’t be reached until after 2023.\n",
      "Some economists, however, see rising risks that inflation could accelerate more than Fed officials expect, forcing them to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated to cool price pressures.\n",
      "The March CPI reading signaled a pickup in consumer prices following months of building inflationary pressures among producers because of supply-chain problems and rising transportation and labor costs, said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. He expects these pressures will keep building into 2022. That will translate into “higher costs for consumers, higher costs for companies that can’t pass it on, higher interest rates,” he said.\n",

      "article_text :  Inflation expectations could be getting somewhat inflated.\n",
      "Capital markets are signaling mounting concerns about inflation among investors. At Thursday’s close, bond prices implied average consumer-price growth of 2.6% over the next five years. In recent weeks, this “inflation break-even” rate has surged to highs not seen since 2008, bolstered by the U.S. reporting official inflation of 4.2%—also a 13-year high. Respondents to the May Fund Manager Survey by Bank of America saw inflation as the biggest “tail risk” to the bull market.\n",
      "Overpaying for inflation insurance, though, is also a risk.\n",
      "Market inflation expectations are calculated as the yield difference between regular Treasurys and Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, which compensate holders for consumer-price index increases. As UBS’ head of U.S. rates Mike Cloherty noted in a report this week, it is a fall in TIPS yields that has been driving the recent rise in breakevens. This tight inverse correlation is reminiscent of the 2009-2013 period of economic weakness, but uncommon for a recovery, when both usually rise in tandem.\n",
      "TIPS are notoriously less liquid, so their prices can move a lot when demand is strong. It currently is: The TIPS inventories of dealer banks are getting depleted. The Federal Reserve, for one, is buying a lot of them. The yield on the five-year note is now hovering around a record low of minus 1.8%. This all points to a reversal.\n",
      "The implication is that breakevens may be overestimating how high inflation might go as a result of a burst in demand for shorter-term inflation hedges. CPI was always expected to surge this year relative to 2020’s steep fall, and longer-term inflation expectations are still within historical ranges. This picture is consistent with the Fed’s new policy of tolerating near-term overshoots, while still making sure inflation stays around 2% in the long run.\n",
      "It would be wrong, however, to say the market isn’t worried. Other traditional inflation hedges have done very well lately, including cheap “value” companies and gold, which is up 9% in two months. Investors know there isn’t a surefire way to know that a short-term spike in prices won’t fuel a lasting spiral. The University of Michigan survey of consumers shows that households expect CPI to be 3.4% over the next five to 10 years, which is the highest figure since 2014.\n",
      "Yet, as the Bank of America survey underscores, the current market jitters reflect fear of tail risks rather than probable outcomes. Even among consumers, average inflation expectations are being skewed by a few respondents who see CPI surging by 10% or more, rather than most households factoring in greater inflation.\n",
      "There is little convincing evidence to support the deeply held belief among economists that expectations themselves can fuel inflation. Workers demanding bigger pay increases in anticipation of inflation can indeed make it worse, but there needs to be some initial trigger, such as the 1970s oil shock or sharp currency depreciations. Even unusually rapid economic recoveries like today’s don’t typically qualify.\n",
      "Investors who truly fear such worst-case scenarios may still want inflation hedges. For the rest, they are becoming a pricey insurance policy.\n",

      "Capital markets are signaling mounting concerns about inflation among investors. At Thursday’s close, bond prices implied average consumer-price growth of 2.6% over the next five years. In recent weeks, this “inflation break-even” rate has surged to highs not seen since 2008, bolstered by the U.S. reporting official inflation of 4.2%—also a 13-year high. Respondents to the May Fund Manager Survey by Bank of America saw inflation as the biggest “tail risk” to the bull market.\n",

      "The CPI measures price changes for a basket of goods and services that is updated every two years.

      "However, the historical gap between the PCE index and the CPI collapsed during the pandemic, and the substitution factor is one reason. “In theory people should buy more of the cheaper stuff and less of the expensive stuff.

      "article_text :  If you’re worried about a return to the double-digit inflation of the 1970s and ’80s, relax. There is a lot of angst these days as a result of the stunning 5% inflation rate (for the year ending May 2021) in the last consumer-price index release. We haven’t seen a reading that high in 13 years, but the huge supply shocks of the double-digit days aren’t present, and the Federal Reserve won’t let inflation soar. It is certainly possible, however, that inflation will linger above the Fed’s 2% target for a while.\n",
      "Two different measures of inflation command attention. Most people focus on the CPI, which reached an eye-popping 5% last month. Financial markets pay more attention to something called the implicit price deflator for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, because the Fed’s inflation target is 2% for the PCE.\n",
      "Does it matter? Yes. For one thing, CPI inflation typically runs higher than PCE inflation. The historical average gap between the two is 0.4% per annum, but there are times when it is much larger—such as today, when the 5% headline CPI figure corresponds to only 3.9% PCE inflation.\n",
      "While 3.9% is better than 5%, it is still far above the Fed’s 2% target. Although Fed officials are playing down the recent inflationary surge as transitory, inflation worrywarts aren’t convinced.\n",
      "One reason is that inflation, once it gets high, is hard to get back down. Normally that is true. But current inflation spikes are driven by special transitory factors. We’ve seen the rise—the 12-month PCE inflation rate leapt from 1.2% to 3.9% in five months—but as these transitory factors dissipate, the decline will likely come.\n",
      "Much of this year’s inflationary surge can be traced to two transitory factors: bounceback from the anomalous negative inflation readings of early 2020 and bottlenecks as the economy reopens unevenly.\n",
      "One simple way to assess the importance of special factors is to consult the trimmed mean inflation series maintained by two of the Federal Reserve banks. These measures ignore the prices with the highest and lowest inflation rates and focus on the rest.\n",
      "It turns out that the Dallas Fed’s trimmed mean PCE inflation rate over the past 12 months is 1.9%, and the Cleveland Fed’s trimmed mean CPI inflation rate is 2.6%. Not very scary. The high-inflation outliers—such as prices for used cars and energy—aren’t illusions, but they won’t persist.\n",
      "A second inflation worry is that the U.S. economy, powered by pent-up consumer demand and huge government expenditures, will soon soar into the inflationary zone. Could be. But there are three counterarguments.\n",
      "First, this worry reflects Phillips curve thinking, which hypothesizes that low unemployment rates make the inflation rate rise. But inflation wasn’t rising before the pandemic despite a 3.5% unemployment rate.\n",
      "Second, the bond market isn’t buying the argument. Inflation forecasts embedded in bond yields remain consistent with the Fed’s low target.\n",
      "Third, much of the extreme fiscal stimulus that has been driving spending is transitory. Most pandemic relief spending will be ending soon, and I don’t think Congress will approve much more spending this year that isn’t paid for.\n",
      "The big question is how pent-up consumer demand will play out. American households socked away about $2 trillion in bank accounts as the pandemic raged. If that money gushes out, we’re likely in for some classic demand-side inflation. But if it gets spent gradually, American businesses will meet demand easily.\n",
      "The third inflation worry is more subtle. Most of the supply-side bottlenecks, such as the shortage of computer chips, are global. Yet inflation is running higher in the U.S. than in other advanced economies. Is this evidence that we’ve used up the slack and are already “running hot”?\n",
      "Perhaps. But on the other side, there has been a huge drop in labor-force participation in the U.S. since February 2020—1.7 percentage points, which corresponds to 2.7 million potential workers. Much of this drop stemmed from pandemic-related problems like fear of the disease, difficulty in getting child care, and generous unemployment benefits—all of which will dissipate over time, giving the labor force room to grow.\n",
      "It takes time for a gigantic economy to normalize after a huge shock. The U.S. doesn’t have a 5% inflation problem. But we may be stuck with inflation above 2%—maybe even above 3%—for a while. The Fed’s latest forecast implies that inflation will tumble next year to 2.1%. I wouldn’t bet on that.\n",

      "article_text :  Americans should brace themselves for several years of higher inflation than they’ve seen in decades, according to economists who expect the robust post-pandemic economic recovery to fuel brisk price increases for a while.\n",
      "Economists surveyed this month by The Wall Street Journal raised their forecasts of how high inflation would go and for how long, compared with their previous expectations in April.\n",
      "The respondents on average now expect a widely followed measure of inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy components, to be up 3.2% in the fourth quarter of 2021 from a year before. They forecast the annual rise to recede to slightly less than 2.3% a year in 2022 and 2023.\n",
      "That would mean an average annual increase of 2.58% from 2021 through 2023, putting inflation at levels last seen in 1993.\n",
      "“We’re in a transitional phase right now,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics LLC. “We are transitioning to a higher period of inflation and interest rates than we’ve had over the last 20 years.”\n",
      "The inflation measure—the Commerce Department’s core price index of personal-consumption expenditures—jumped 3.4% in May from a year earlier, the biggest increase since the early 1990s.\n",
      "What Mr. Naroff and the other survey respondents describe is a generational shift from the lower inflation of the past two decades, a shift that could create new challenges for households, policy makers and investors who came to expect inflation closer to or below 2%.\n",
      "If the economists prove correct, Federal Reserve officials might have to raise rates sooner or more than they expect to keep inflation under control.\n",
      "The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge—the overall PCE index, which includes food and energy prices—rose 3.9% in May, nearly double the central bank’s 2% target. The Fed, in a report released Friday, repeated its view that inflation has picked up this year due to bottlenecks, hiring difficulties and other “largely transitory factors” related to the economy’s rebound from the effects of the pandemic. Most officials, in projections released last month, believed inflation would decline to around 2% over the next two years, though there was greater uncertainty over how quickly they might need to raise interest rates to get inflation there.\n",
      "At the Fed’s June policy meeting, most officials projected they would raise interest rates from near zero by 2023. Several expected to raise rates next year. In March, most officials expected to hold rates steady through 2023.\n",
      "Some 58% of the economists surveyed don’t see the Fed raising interest rates until the second half of 2022 or later.\n",
      "“Inflation is expected to surge longer and longer—longer than the Fed previously thought,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “The Fed is now likely to raise rates in the first half of 2023, although some Fed presidents will be nipping at the bit to move sooner.”\n",
      "Some respondents worry the Fed could move too slowly. “The danger is that monetary authorities are behind the curve,” said Kevin Swift, chief economist at the American Chemistry Council. “I’m not saying hyperinflation is around the corner, just that a lot of things have come together in the last year, and the overall trend of costs across the board is growing faster than in the last five or 10 years.”\n",
      "Core PCE inflation rose just 1.7% annually, on average, between 1995 and 2019. Now the Fed wants inflation to overshoot 2% for a while to make up for that shortfall.\n",
      "Another key measure of inflation, the Labor Department’s consumer-price index, which tends to run hotter than the PCE index, leapt 5% in May from a year before, the most in nearly 13 years. Survey respondents expect the department to report Tuesday that the CPI rose 4.7% in June from a year before. They expect the rate to fall to 4.1% by year’s end. Their CPI forecasts for next year and 2023 hover between 2.4% and 2.7%.\n",
      "Supply-chain bottlenecks, higher shipping costs and labor shortages might prove temporary as the market adjusts to disruptions. However, the combination of plentiful federal stimulus funding, an unprecedented stockpile of household savings and the rollout of vaccines is driving a surge in consumer demand, enabling many businesses to raise prices significantly for the first time in decades. If households and businesses start to expect rising prices, that dynamic can become self-fulfilling.\n",
      "There are signs that consumers are starting to anticipate higher inflation. Consumer inflation expectations—the rate of inflation the median consumer expects five to 10 years from now—climbed to 2.8% in June, about the same rate as in 2014, according to the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers.\n",
      "Has your outlook on the economy changed recently? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n",
      "Higher inflation for several years would ripple through the economy in various ways. Consumers could find their household budgets squeezed. Higher borrowing costs could weigh on stock values and could crimp growth in interest-rate-sensitive industries like housing. Higher inflation can also make it harder for businesses to plan longer-term investments.\n",
      "“It’s disruptive—you can’t be sure of what your costs are, whether you can get supplies or what the costs will be six months from now,” Mr. Swift said. “I’d hate to be in the construction business trying to bid on a job when you don’t know what the cost of steel will be 18 months from now.”\n",

      "article_text :  The Federal Reserve employs hundreds of economists whose job is assessing the American economy. So it is remarkable that the Fed is so wrong so often in its economic forecasts. The latest big miss has been its failure to anticipate this year’s surge in consumer prices.\n",
      "Fed Chairman Jerome Powell conceded at his press conference Wednesday that prices had caught the central bank by surprise, but he showed no particular concern. The Federal Open Market Committee’s statement Wednesday after its two-day meeting also showed little interest in reeling in what has been the most reckless monetary policy since Arthur Burns roamed the Eccles Building. History hasn’t been kind to Burns.\n",
      "Let’s compare actual inflation with the Fed’s forecasts. The nearby chart shows the estimates of inflation by Fed officials for 2021 and price increases this year. Fed governors and regional bank presidents offer their economic estimates of growth, unemployment, inflation and interest rates each quarter. The chart shows the median estimate of the Fed forecasters from June 2020 to last month for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator, the Fed’s favorite price index.\n",
      "Note that through December 2020 Fed officials assumed PCE inflation this year of 1.8%. By March they had bumped that up to 2.4% as price pressures were already being felt. In June the median had climbed to 3.4%.\n",
      "Yet even that catch-up drill underestimated the price surge. The PCE index had already climbed 3.6% in April from a year ago and 3.9% in May; the June figure will be out Friday.\n",
      "The consumer price index, which is calculated differently, rose at an even faster rate. As the chart shows, the CPI increased at an annual 5.4% rate in June, after rising 5% at an annual rate in May. The Fed is way behind the price curve. Price increases would have to decline precipitously in the next six months to get close to the Fed’s median June forecast of 3.4% for 2021, much less its 2% inflation target.\n",
      "On Wednesday Chairman Powell again explained the inflation miss as the result of the unusual nature of this economic recovery. Supply bottlenecks are creating shortages that are causing temporary price increases, he says, and he’s right about the shortages.\n",
      "But this lets the Fed off the hook too easily for its monetary policy. The Fed had to act in spring 2020 to prevent the pandemic lockdowns from becoming another depression. But it has maintained its policy of near-zero interest rates and $120 billion a month in bond purchases for 16 months.\n",
      "It has done so despite a roaring economy and rapid job creation. The National Bureau of Economic Research reported last week that the pandemic recession officially ended in April 2020 after only two months. The economic recovery has accelerated this year as the vaccines have come on line. Economists are anticipating that Thursday’s GDP report will show growth in the second quarter of 8%.\n",
      "Even by the Fed’s own theory of what causes inflation—the output gap between actual and potential production—prices should be rising. What output gap? The labor participation rate hasn’t returned to its pre-pandemic level, but with the many disincentives to work coming from Washington, millions may stay on the sidelines no matter what employers pay.\n",
      "Until he recently took a vow of silence on fiscal policy, Mr. Powell also spent a year prodding Congress to spend ever-more trillions of dollars that have spurred economic demand even as supply is constrained. This has also contributed to inflation, and the mountain of new debt has made it harder politically for the Fed to taper its purchases of Treasurys. You don’t have to be a cynic to wonder if the Fed privately now wants more inflation to ease that rising debt burden. The progressive intelligentsia is already making that case.\n",
      "Consumers may feel differently, as they pay more for goods and services across the economy. Housing prices are soaring out of reach for millions. The public’s optimism about the economy from earlier this year has ebbed, and more voters are expressing concern about rising prices. The White House can read the polls.\n",
      "One trait of the modern Fed is never to take responsibility for financial and economic problems. The financial panic of 2008 was the bankers’ fault. The historically slow expansion after 2009 was the fault of fiscal policy. Now the inflation surge is due to forces beyond its control. If the Powell Fed won’t even accept responsibility for the price level, which is central to the Fed’s mission, maybe it’s time for a Fed Chairman who will.\n",

      "article_text :  Inflation cooled slightly in August but remained strong, as a surge in Covid-19 infections slowed economic growth and pandemic-related shortages of labor and supplies continued to drive up prices.\n",
      "The Labor Department said last month’s consumer-price index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in August from July, slower than the 0.5% one-month increase in July, and down markedly from June’s 0.9% pace. Prices eased for autos, with used vehicle prices dropping sharply, and hotel rates and airline fares declined in August from July.\n",
      "The CPI measures what consumers pay for goods and services, including groceries, clothes, restaurant meals, recreation and vehicles. On an annual basis, price pressures eased slightly. The department’s consumer-price index rose 5.3% in August from a year earlier, down from the 5.4% pace in June and July, on an unadjusted basis.\n",
      "The so-called core price index, which excludes the often volatile categories of food and energy, climbed 4% from a year before, they estimate, compared with 4.3% in July.\n",
      "Price growth driven by used vehicles eased in August. The recovery of travel-related prices also reversed as the spread of the Delta variant of the Covid-19 virus depressed demand, particularly for travel. Airline fare prices declined 9.1% from July, while rental cars and trucks dropped 8.5%.\n",
      "“We could see further declines in virus sensitive components in coming months,” said Laura Rosner-Warburton, senior economist at MacroPolicy Perspectives, “although lingering supply chain issues will likely produce continued upward pressure on goods prices, including used cars.”\n",
      "Gasoline prices picked up 2.8% in August from July, a faster pace than the prior month. Restaurant prices rose 0.4%, while grocery prices climbed 0.4%, both categories rising at a slightly slower monthly pace than in July. Among the supermarket items that jumped the most were salad dressing, which increased 4% in August from July, and bacon, up 3.3%.\n",
      "Inflation is eroding household-spending power despite wage increases in some industries. For the lowest-paid Americans, real wages—adjusted for rising prices—fell 0.5% in August from a year earlier, according to data from the Labor Department and the Atlanta Fed.\n",
      "Inflation has heated up this year for several reasons. U.S. gross domestic product rose at a rapid 6.6% seasonally adjusted annual rate in the second quarter, fueled by a gush of consumer demand. Spending jumped at an 11.9% pace in the second quarter as more people received vaccinations, businesses reopened and trillions of dollars in federal aid coursed through the economy.\n",
      "Prices for services hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic are still recovering to pre-pandemic levels, including for air travel, accommodation, entertainment and recreation. The outbreak of the Delta variant of the Covid-19 virus likely weakened that rebound, taking some stress off overall price pressures in August, many economists say. At the same time, Delta-driven disruptions due to shutdowns and absenteeism could also worsen supply bottlenecks and shortages.\n",
      "Many companies are passing on higher labor and materials costs to consumers. The sharp uptick in restaurant prices in the past few months suggests that this pass-through is showing up in the inflation data, say economists. From June through August, fast-food prices rose at an annual rate of 9.7%, according to Labor Department data, which is seasonally adjusted.\n",
      "“Peak pandemic pressures have likely passed, but significant pressures remain,” said Aichi Amemiya, senior U.S. economist at Nomura Securities.\n",
      "One prime example is the shortage of semiconductors that has crimped auto production, causing new and used-vehicle prices to soar, which in turn drove up overall CPI throughout the late spring and summer. However, supply of new autos remains limited, due to the chip shortage and a resurgence of Covid-19 infections in Asia that led to shutdowns of factories and ports, said Mr. Amemiya. While the jump in used-car prices is now easing, prices for new vehicles are still rising, he said.\n",
      "More broadly, hopes are fading that supply-chain disruptions would pass after a few months.\n",
      "“I think what we’re learning is that our supply chains were more vulnerable than previously thought and it’s difficult to make a quick turnaround,” said Andrew Schneider, U.S. economist at BNP Paribas.\n",
      "Jared Simon owns a furniture, mattress and appliance store in the Boston suburb of Franklin, Mass. He has been struggling with shortages, delays and high shipping costs for the past year. Things worsened, however, in August, as absenteeism due to Covid-19 heightened worker shortages among manufacturers and shippers, exacerbating delays.\n",
      "“I had one factory that almost had to suspend production because they ran out of twine to tie coils together. The twine producer had four people running a production line that normally has 12 employees because they were out with Covid,” he said, noting that a similar thing happened with his cotton supplier. Another vendor stopped production in late August after it ran out of places to put finished goods due to a backup in shipping.\n",
      "Mr. Simon said that as his company’s vendors have passed on increased costs, he in turn has passed those on to consumers. “With shortages, it is easier to pass on increases since consumers need the items right away,” he said.\n",
      "Economists anticipate that broader, longer-lasting inflationary pressures will emerge in coming quarters. For example, many expect a rebound in rent to buoy overall CPI in the months ahead. Combined, the Labor Department’s various measures of rent make up about one-third of the prices for the CPI’s hypothetical basket of goods and services, and could therefore buoy the overall inflation measure.\n",
      "Federal Reserve officials are closely watching many inflation measures to gauge whether the recent jump in prices will prove temporary or lasting. Persistent high inflation could compel them to tighten their easy-money policies sooner than expected—or to react more aggressively later—to achieve their 2% average inflation goal.\n",
      "One factor they watch is consumer expectations of future inflation, which can prove self-fulfilling. Consumers’ median inflation expectation for three years from now leapt to 4% in August, from 3.7% a month earlier, according to a survey by the New York Fed. August’s reading was the highest since the survey began in 2013.\n",
      "How concerned are you about rising prices? Join the conversation below.\n",
      "Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in late August reiterated his view that inflation is likely to cool over time, as supply-chain bottlenecks and other effects related to the economy’s reopening subside. So far, there is little evidence that inflation is rising beyond a “relatively narrow group of goods and services that have been directly affected by the pandemic and the reopening of the economy,” he said.\n",
      "The easing of price growth in August on the surface supports Fed analysis that says inflationary pressures could be largely temporary. However, an alternative measure of inflation tracked by the Cleveland Fed suggests a broadening of price pressures.\n",
      "A consumer-inflation reading that captures price changes in the middle of the index while discarding extreme price changes, known as the 16% trimmed-mean CPI, rose 3.2% in August compared with the same month a year ago, up from 3% in July and well above the 2% average between 2012 and 2019.\n",
      "The dampening of price pressures in August from July isn’t necessarily a sign that the inflation flare-up of the past few months is dying down for good, said Ms. Rosner-Warburton.\n",
      "The August CPI report “might be a little bit of a headfake” in signaling that the recent inflation surge is behind us, “but other factors might be moving under the surface,” she said. “There is a growing risk that higher inflation exacerbated by ongoing supply-chain frictions could put a dent in demand next year.”\n",

      "article_text :  While many pandemic-driven price pressures are easing, broader sources of higher inflation are replacing them.\n",
      "That is the message from a slew of alternative inflation measures that strip away price changes due to idiosyncratic swings in supply and demand, and home in on longer-lasting pressures.\n",
      "These alternative indexes are signaling “inflation is not as extreme as what the headline or traditional core shows right now, but it is picking up,” said Sarah House, director and senior economist at Wells Fargo.\n",
      "“All of these measures have moved from signaling price stability to signaling sharp accelerations in underlying inflation,” said Brent Meyer, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.\n",
      "Some economists interpret this as inflation returning to levels consistent with a healthy economy, after being too low before the pandemic. “To now see price pressures picking up, but not at extremely worrying levels—it’s progress,” said Blerina Uruci, senior U.S. economist at Barclays.\n",
      "Inflation as measured by the Labor Department’s consumer-price index was 5.3% in the 12 months through August, close to the highest in 12 years. Economists generally expect that to fall, but disagree on how much. They attribute much of the recent surge in prices to temporary causes—such as a post-vaccine spending upsurge, specific supply-chain problems and other production bottlenecks—that should fade as businesses ramp up output.\n",
      "But a key question is whether prices will continue to rise more persistently once these temporary disruptions end.\n",
      "The Federal Reserve has argued that inflation will recede to just above its 2% target by 2022. Nonetheless, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, asked last week whether inflation is now broader and more structural than earlier this year, responded, “Yes, I think it’s fair to say that it is.”\n",
      "There were signs in August that cost increases related to supply disruptions had begun easing. The core consumer-price index, which excludes the often volatile categories of food and energy, rose just 0.1% from July, the smallest monthly increase since February. Prices for used vehicles dropped sharply, as did hotel rates and airline fares, possibly due to the impact of the Delta variant on travel.\n",
      "Alternative inflation measures can help suggest where inflation is headed, by cutting out statistical noise or zeroing in on historical pricing patterns, said Alex Lin, U.S. economist at BofA Global Research. For example, some remove extreme price swings like June’s surge in used-vehicle prices, which accounted for more than one-third of that month’s CPI increase.\n",
      "The Cleveland Fed’s 16% trimmed-mean CPI—which lops off the most extreme price changes—and its median CPI, capturing the middle-most price change, both grew at the same month-over-month rate in August as in July, suggesting that falling prices for airline fares, hotels and rental cars caused the overall CPI to overstate the slowdown in inflation.\n",
      "The inflation shown by these indexes is lower than the trend in the CPI and core CPI, but still well above 2%, and—unlike those mainstream measures—continued to climb in August. The trimmed-mean CPI rose 3.2% in August compared with the same month a year earlier, up from 3% in July and well above the 2% average between 2012 and 2019.\n",
      "The rising trimmed mean alongside a more sluggish pickup in the median CPI signals that while many prices are experiencing above-average inflation, most are not, said Robert W. Rich, director at the Cleveland Fed’s Center for Inflation Research.\n",
      "The median suggests “inflation will move back down to a range consistent with the Fed’s long-term target, while the trimmed mean is suggesting there is more upside risk,” he said. The unprecedented nature of the pandemic shock makes interpreting these movements unusually hard, he cautioned.\n",
      "An index from the San Francisco Fed that reslices CPI based on historical pricing patterns also signals that temporary price spikes caused by imbalances in supply and demand are fading.\n",
      "This index regroups the Commerce Department’s core personal-consumption expenditure price index into a cyclical index, whose components are more sensitive to the strength of the economy because they go up when the labor market tightens, and into an acyclical series of all other prices. During expansions of the last 25 years, acyclical inflation was usually lower than cyclical inflation, but it was faster from April to June. Now the two are about the same.\n",
      "Have you noticed inflation in items that aren’t directly affected by shortages? Join the conversation below.\n",
      "The Atlanta Fed’s sticky-price CPI is also signaling a pickup in underlying inflation. The index includes only items whose prices change relatively infrequently, meaning that they react slowly to changes in economic conditions—for example, medical care and rent.\n",
      "“By tracking this measure, we think we’re getting something that’s telling us about…inflation a year or two or three out. And that measure is starting to move up,” said the Altanta Fed’s Mr. Meyer. The sticky-price CPI in August rose 2.6% from a year earlier, a slight acceleration from July, and nearing the 2.8% rate that prevailed just before the pandemic.\n",
      "The significant increase in price pressure signaled by this and the other indexes is a potential worry, Mr. Meyer said.\n",

      "article_text :  While many pandemic-driven price pressures are easing, broader sources of higher inflation are replacing them.\n",
      "That is the message from a slew of alternative inflation measures that strip away price changes due to idiosyncratic swings in supply and demand, and home in on longer-lasting pressures.\n",
      "These alternative indexes are signaling “inflation is not as extreme as what the headline or traditional core shows right now, but it is picking up,” said Sarah House, director and senior economist at Wells Fargo.\n",
      "“All of these measures have moved from signaling price stability to signaling sharp accelerations in underlying inflation,” said Brent Meyer, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.\n",
      "Some economists interpret this as inflation returning to levels consistent with a healthy economy, after being too low before the pandemic. “To now see price pressures picking up, but not at extremely worrying levels—it’s progress,” said Blerina Uruci, senior U.S. economist at Barclays.\n",
      "Inflation as measured by the Labor Department’s consumer-price index was 5.3% in the 12 months through August, close to the highest in 12 years. Economists generally expect that to fall, but disagree on how much. They attribute much of the recent surge in prices to temporary causes—such as a post-vaccine spending upsurge, specific supply-chain problems and other production bottlenecks—that should fade as businesses ramp up output.\n",
      "But a key question is whether prices will continue to rise more persistently once these temporary disruptions end.\n",
      "The Federal Reserve has argued that inflation will recede to just above its 2% target by 2022. Nonetheless, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, asked last week whether inflation is now broader and more structural than earlier this year, responded, “Yes, I think it’s fair to say that it is.”\n",
      "There were signs in August that cost increases related to supply disruptions had begun easing. The core consumer-price index, which excludes the often volatile categories of food and energy, rose just 0.1% from July, the smallest monthly increase since February. Prices for used vehicles dropped sharply, as did hotel rates and airline fares, possibly due to the impact of the Delta variant on travel.\n",
      "Alternative inflation measures can help suggest where inflation is headed, by cutting out statistical noise or zeroing in on historical pricing patterns, said Alex Lin, U.S. economist at BofA Global Research. For example, some remove extreme price swings like June’s surge in used-vehicle prices, which accounted for more than one-third of that month’s CPI increase.\n",
      "The Cleveland Fed’s 16% trimmed-mean CPI—which lops off the most extreme price changes—and its median CPI, capturing the middle-most price change, both grew at the same month-over-month rate in August as in July, suggesting that falling prices for airline fares, hotels and rental cars caused the overall CPI to overstate the slowdown in inflation.\n",
      "The inflation shown by these indexes is lower than the trend in the CPI and core CPI, but still well above 2%, and—unlike those mainstream measures—continued to climb in August. The trimmed-mean CPI rose 3.2% in August compared with the same month a year earlier, up from 3% in July and well above the 2% average between 2012 and 2019.\n",
      "The rising trimmed mean alongside a more sluggish pickup in the median CPI signals that while many prices are experiencing above-average inflation, most are not, said Robert W. Rich, director at the Cleveland Fed’s Center for Inflation Research.\n",
      "The median suggests “inflation will move back down to a range consistent with the Fed’s long-term target, while the trimmed mean is suggesting there is more upside risk,” he said. The unprecedented nature of the pandemic shock makes interpreting these movements unusually hard, he cautioned.\n",
      "An index from the San Francisco Fed that reslices CPI based on historical pricing patterns also signals that temporary price spikes caused by imbalances in supply and demand are fading.\n",
      "This index regroups the Commerce Department’s core personal-consumption expenditure price index into a cyclical index, whose components are more sensitive to the strength of the economy because they go up when the labor market tightens, and into an acyclical series of all other prices. During expansions of the last 25 years, acyclical inflation was usually lower than cyclical inflation, but it was faster from April to June. Now the two are about the same.\n",
      "Have you noticed inflation in items that aren’t directly affected by shortages? Join the conversation below.\n",
      "The Atlanta Fed’s sticky-price CPI is also signaling a pickup in underlying inflation. The index includes only items whose prices change relatively infrequently, meaning that they react slowly to changes in economic conditions—for example, medical care and rent.\n",
      "“By tracking this measure, we think we’re getting something that’s telling us about…inflation a year or two or three out. And that measure is starting to move up,” said the Altanta Fed’s Mr. Meyer. The sticky-price CPI in August rose 2.6% from a year earlier, a slight acceleration from July, and nearing the 2.8% rate that prevailed just before the pandemic.\n",
      "The significant increase in price pressure signaled by this and the other indexes is a potential worry, Mr. Meyer said.\n",

      "China’s exports, long a growth engine for the country’s economy, are expected to increase 21% from a year earlier in September, according to economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. That is down from a 25.6% gain in August. Meanwhile, inbound shipments are forecast to rise 19.1% from a year earlier, retreating from the 33.1% jump in August.\n",
      "The International Monetary Fund releases its World Economic Outlook report during annual meetings. The latest forecasts are likely to underscore the relatively quick economic rebound of advanced economies alongside a slower recovery in developing nations with less access to Covid-19 vaccines.\n",
      "China’s factory-gate prices for September are expected to surge 10.4% from a year earlier, a pace that would surpass its previous peak in 2008, according to economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. Higher commodity costs have led to the rise in producer prices this year, but so far that hasn’t fed through to consumer inflation. Economists forecast the consumer-price index rose only 0.7% from a year earlier in September.\n",
      "September’s U.S. consumer-price index is expected to show inflation remained elevated as companies passed along higher costs for materials and labor. Rising energy prices likely contributed to the headline CPI, while core prices, which exclude food and energy, might start to reflect climbing shelter costs.\n",
      "The Federal Reserve releases minutes from its September meeting, potentially offering additional insight on plans to start reducing pandemic-related stimulus.\n",
      "U.S. jobless claims are forecast to fall for the second consecutive week as employers hold on to workers in a tight labor market. The data on claims, a proxy for layoffs, will cover the week ended Oct. 9.\n",
      "U.S. retail sales are expected to fall in September. U.S. consumers appear to be in decent financial shape, but Covid-related caution, rising prices and widespread supply-chain disruptions are tamping down purchases. The auto industry has been especially hard hit by a semiconductor shortage—separate data released earlier this month show U.S. vehicle sales in September fell to their lowest level since early in the pandemic.\n",

      "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida kick off a full week of remarks from central-bank officials as they wind down aggressive, pandemic-driven stimulus amid rising concerns about inflation. Mr. Clarida’s remarks, on inflation and prospects for monetary policy, could draw special attention.\n",
      "China’s producer-price index, a gauge of factory-gate prices, rose at the fastest pace in 25 years in September as the costs of coal and some energy-intensive products show big increases. Economists forecast an even larger PPI jump for October, potentially raising fears of stagflation, when prices keep rising during periods of slower growth. Higher factory-gate prices have been slow to filter through to consumers, though forecasts are that October’s CPI will be up 1.4% from a year earlier—double September’s 0.7%.\n",
      "U.S. consumer prices this year have been rising at the fastest rate in more than a decade, complicating efforts to get the economy back on track after Covid-19-related disruptions. Economists forecast yet another pickup for inflation in October, fueled by higher energy costs, rising rents, costlier used vehicles, and the mix of supply-chain snarls and wage increases that have marked the latest stages of the recovery.\n",
      "U.S. jobless claims have been on a steady downward march as employers do their best to hold on to workers in a tight labor market. Economists forecast that applications for unemployment benefits, a proxy for layoffs, will show a fresh pandemic low for the week ended Nov. 6.\n",
      "U.K. economic growth is expected to slow in the third quarter. Gross domestic product is forecast to be up 1.5% from the prior quarter as supply-chain bottlenecks, including shortages of truck drivers and gasoline, hamper the recovery. GDP had posted a 4.8% jump in the second quarter.\n",

The supply constraints will eventually dissipate. Policy makers can’t wait to tone down the bulging pipeline of monetary and fiscal stimulus.\n",

Inflation of the median CPI component was 1.4% before the pandemic and has risen to 4.6%. A little more than a third of all CPI components are now experiencing inflation above 6%, a sevenfold increase compared with January 2020, and 14% of the CPI’s components are experiencing inflation exceeding 6%, also a 7-fold increase. Only 9% of all CPI components are experiencing price declines, compared with 32% before the pandemic. The widening array of price increases of frequently purchased items is fueling higher inflationary expectations that is reinforcing higher wages and prices.\n",

Because of how they are calculated, OER and rents are notorious laggards and will pick up sharply at least through the end of 2023.\n",
      "Wages are accelerating, fueled by strong demand for labor, insufficient supply and a catch-up of wages to higher inflation and inflationary expectations. The Fed now projects the unemployment rate will fall to 3.5% from 4.2% by the end of 2022. Employees have the upper hand, as businesses strive to produce more to meet demand and replenish inventories. Workers know businesses have the flexibility to raise product prices. Tamping down on excess demand is necessary to interrupt this feedback loop between increases in wages and inflation.\n",
      "The Fed has a history of being too slow to remove stimulus following recoveries from recession. Rising inflation is driving real interest rates deeply negative while the M2 money supply continues to rise 13% year-over-year and is up 38% since February 2020. Even if inflation recedes sharply to the Fed’s new upwardly revised forecasts—which seems like a long shot—the new federal-funds rate would remain below inflation and below the Fed’s estimate of a neutral monetary policy.\n",
      "The Fed should commence raising rates at its January meeting. Markets need to be prepared for the possibility that rates eventually may be pushed higher than currently anticipated. Congress also needs to be prepared, since higher interest rates will add to the government’s debt-service costs. The stock market may fall in response, but delaying monetary normalization may undercut the sustainability of healthy economic growth.\n",
      "Fiscal policy also needs a reset. Tight labor markets and inflation require a more realistic debate about the economic effects of government spending. Deficit spending from prior legislation continues to flow into the overheated economy. The American Jobs and Infrastructure Act has authorized another $1 trillion in deficit spending over 10 years.\n",
      "The nation’s infrastructure has depreciated and requires investment. But history shows that government spending on investment has far higher fiscal multipliers than transfer payments do. Whether the government infrastructure initiatives add to longer-run productive capacity depends on whether the projects are chosen wisely and implemented efficiently.\n",
      "The Biden administration should resist the political incentive to front-run infrastructure spending aimed primarily at job creation, which would fuel stronger demand and aggravate labor supply shortages, and instead focus initially on infrastructure initiatives that add the most to longer-run productive capacity like improving the electrical grid, cybersecurity and infrastructure at ports. All government spending on infrastructure will add to near-term demand, but not all government spending will enhance productivity and add to longer-run growth.\n",
      "The debate about the Build Back Better Act should give way to a consideration of the efficacy of its separate initiatives, differentiating between those that truly show promise—like universal prekindergarten—and income support and redistribution programs.

       "  'article_text': 'A broad uptick in economic growth around the world in 2017 has led economists at the World Bank to conclude that, for the first time in a decade, the global economy is operating at its potential.\\n\"The year 2018 will likely mark a turning point for the global economy because, for the first time since 2008, the negative global output gap is expected to be closed,\" the World Bank said in its flagship report on the global economy, known as the Global Economic Prospects report.\\nAt the root of this observation is a calculation that the world economy performed far worse than its potential in the decade after the global financial crisis that sent most of the world\\'s economies into severe recession. This difference between the economy\\'s actual performance and its potential is known as the output gap. When output gaps are large, as they have been the past 10 years, it indicates weak economic demand, spare capacity of businesses and factories, widespread unemployment and a major drag on inflationary pressures.\\nAlthough the overall global output gap has closed, some countries are still operating below potential, especially commodity exporters. Others, especially the world\\'s advanced economies, appear to be somewhat \"above potential,\" meaning that the economy has more demand than is sustainable in the long-run. Excess demand is likely to lead to inflationary pressures, an increase in asset prices and pressure on central banks to raise interest rates.\\nClosing the output gap could trigger a broad change in economic conditions around the world.\\nFor much of the past decade, inflation around the world has been weak, with many nations fearing they could slip into deflationary spirals. A large global output gap meant that countries faced little price pressure from the rest of the world.\\xa0Central banks such as the Federal Reserve or European Central Bank have had the luxury to move slowly in reversing years of unprecedented expansionary monetary policy, because inflation pressures were so low. Now, international inflationary pressures could be on the return.\\n\"Slack in the rest of the world forces firms to keep costs at a certain level,\" said Ayhan Kose, the director of the World Bank\\'s Development Economic Prospects Group. \"In 2018, that is disappearing.\"\\nWith the gap only narrowly closed, and uncertainty around that estimate, Mr. Kose cautions that the inflationary pressures could remain modest in 2018.\\nThe closing of the gap owes to a broad-based improvement in growth around the world.\\nIn the World Bank\\'s latest estimates, U.S. and Japanese economic growth in 2017 came in 0.2 percentage points stronger than in the previous round of estimates in June. China\\'s growth beat June\\'s estimates by 0.3 percentage points. Growth in the euro area came in 0.7 percentage points stronger.\\nOverall, the world\\'s economy grew 3% in 2017, the World Bank said, up from the June estimate of 2.7%, and a considerable strengthening from the 2.4% growth that was logged in 2016. The World Bank forecasts that growth will pick up a bit more in 2018, rising to 3.1%.\\nDespite a growth surge and closing output gap, however, the report\\'s authors caution that risks to the economy remain significant,\\xa0with potential growth slowing in many economies due to aging demographics, slowing productivity growth and less investment than in the past.\\xa0 Adding to those risks are global central banks shifting to tighter monetary policies, and many governments around the world with unsustainable fiscal outlooks.\\nRELATED\\nJust Four Large Countries Have a Higher Debt Burden Than the U.S.\\nGlobal Economies Grow In Sync\\nCentral Banks Pull Back as Global Growth Picture Bright\\n'},\n",

       "  'article_text': 'Analysts watching bumpy economic data in the U.S. and Europe often focus on the signal—the long-term trend—and ignore the noise. For China’s official GDP data, the rule is the opposite: Ignore the implausibly smooth signal and search for the noise.\\nChina’s 2017 headline growth came out at 6.9%, a touch higher than 2016’s 6.7%. A last-minute delay in releasing the data Thursday won’t do much to boost investors’ confidence in its accuracy, following a string of admissions this month on padded data from the hardscrabble industrial north.\\nLuckily, there is plenty of more-reliable data—like freight volumes, lending, real-estate investment, and purchasing managers’ employment data—and they all tell a remarkably similar story: China experienced a sharp slowdown in late 2014 followed by a rapid rebound starting in early 2016 and gaining pace for most of last year.\\nThe question is, What happens next?\\nMost of the reliable indicators tied to industry show growth peaking in mid or late 2017, and now trending gradually down. Since income growth tends to follow corporate profits in China, it’s a good bet consumption will initially hold up in 2018, helping offset the slowdown in investment.\\nThere are two big near-term risks.\\nThe first is a rise in trade tensions. Exports matter less to China than they used to, but they were key to its hitting the sweet spot—rising growth and falling indebtedness—last year. A hard knock from across the Pacific would make that hard to repeat—and damage income growth too—tempting Chinese leaders to ramp up lending again. Commodities would benefit, but China’s long-term prospects would dim.\\nThe second risk is that credit stops flowing. Despite all the deleveraging talk, the annual rate of broad credit growth in China was still a healthy 13% in December, down only a bit from its recent peak of 17% in April 2016.\\nRegulatory actions in January suggest the next target in the campaign against leverage could be a type of shadow financing called “entrusted” company-to-company loans, which would put businesses in a tough spot.\\nEverything went right for Chinese growth in 2017. A disaster this year looks unlikely, but slower credit growth and rising trade tensions could test the current near-euphoric sentiment—and certain asset classes like commodities and bubbly industrial equities.\\nWrite to Nathaniel Taplin at nathaniel.taplin@wsj.com\\n'},\n",

       "  'article_text': 'The U.S. economy entered 2018 with stronger momentum than earlier thought, though corporate profits weakened at the end of 2017 against a backdrop of significant changes to the tax code.\\nGross domestic product, a broad measure of the goods and services produced across the U.S., rose at a 2.9% annual rate in the fourth quarter, adjusted for seasonality and inflation, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.\\nThat exceeded economists’ expectations and was up from a previous estimate of 2.5% growth, and only a little slower than the third quarter’s 3.2% growth and 3.1% growth in the second quarter. Consumer spending was revised higher for the fourth quarter, and private inventories exerted a smaller drag on growth than earlier thought.\\nOverall growth in the almost-finished first quarter is shaping up on the softer side; forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers on Wednesday projected a 1.8% growth rate for GDP in the first three months of the year.\\nStill, total output expanded 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with a year earlier, and many economists expect another strong year in 2018—aided by tax cuts, government spending, rising incomes, low unemployment and healthy growth overseas.\\n“The bottom line is that the U.S. economy remains on a solid footing,” said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, in a note.\\nWednesday’s report also contained the government’s first broad estimate of profits at U.S. companies in the fourth quarter. After-tax corporate profits, without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, fell 9.6% from the prior quarter and were down 6.0% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier.\\nCorporate profits weakened in 2015 as the U.S. energy industry was squeezed by plunging oil prices, but earnings have picked up over the past two years.\\nThe weak reading for the final months of 2017 may have reflected one-time effects of the wide-reaching tax legislation enacted in December. The Commerce Department said several provisions took effect in the fourth quarter—changes to the expensing of bonus depreciation and a one-time repatriation tax on foreign earnings.\\n“I would certainly peg it to that,” said Christine Short, senior vice president at analytics firm Estimize.\\nAmong other things, the tax legislation enacted in December slashed the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% starting Jan. 1. It scrambled fourth-quarter earnings at some large public companies due to various one-time effects, and may have created an incentive for some firms to shift earnings and expenses between late 2017 and early 2018. It could take several quarters for tax-related noise to fade from the profits data.\\nMs. Short said business earnings are benefiting from solid economic growth.\\n“The underlying trend for 2018 is still very good,” she said.\\nConsumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of total economic output. Wednesday’s report said personal-consumption expenditures rose at a 4.0% annual rate in the fourth quarter, revised up from a previous estimate of 3.8% growth and the strongest quarterly reading in three years.\\nYear-end spending was boosted by robust outlays on durable goods as many Americans replaced motor vehicles and other items damaged by several powerful late-summer hurricanes.\\nBusiness investment remained solid in the fourth quarter, with fixed nonresidential investment rising at a 6.8% annual rate. Capital expenditures were led by 11.6% growth for spending on equipment.\\nThe housing sector was a tailwind for growth in late 2017 as residential investment rose at a 12.8% annual pace. Government expenditures were up at a 3.0% annual rate in the fourth quarter, including a 5.5% growth rate for federal spending on national defense.\\nNet exports subtracted 1.16 percentage points from the quarter’s 2.9% GDP growth rate, and inventories subtracted 0.53 percentage point. Both categories tend to be volatile from quarter to quarter.\\nWrite to Ben Leubsdorf at ben.leubsdorf@wsj.com\\n'},\n",

       "  'article_text': 'The Bureau of Economic Analysis will release its preliminary first-quarter growth figure on Friday. According to the Atlanta Fed consensus tracker, economists are predicting gross domestic product to have risen at a meager 2% annual rate. But a powerful behind-the-scenes indicator suggests the real rate may turn out to be significantly higher.\\n“Gross output,” or GO, reflects the full value of the supply chain—the business-to-business spending that moves all goods and services toward the final retail market. Based on my work and research by David Ranson, chief economist at HCWE & Co., changes in the supply chain are a strong leading indicator of the next quarter’s GDP.\\nThe supply chain, which the BEA calls “intermediate inputs,” took off in the fourth quarter of 2017, growing at a 7.5% annualized rate. That’s more than double the rate of real GDP growth and the fastest pace since before the Great Recession. Real GO, which includes both GDP and the supply chain, rose at a 4.7% rate. The growth was broad-based, with strong numbers in mining, manufacturing, utilities and construction. The fourth quarter 2017 GDP growth rate of 2.9% did not reflect the dramatic increases in intermediate outputs because GDP by definition measures only spending at the end of the economic chain.\\nThe GO model is more in keeping with the Conference Board’s list of 10 leading economic indicators, which are linked to manufacturing and capital markets. For three quarters in a row in 2017, GO accelerated, probably due to the anticipated tax breaks and deregulatory environment. The boom in intermediate business activity should translate into higher economic growth soon, barring international instability, trade wars, or tighter-than-expected monetary policy.\\nAs I noted in these pages in 2014, measuring gross output is a breakthrough in national income accounting. By reporting GO as well as GDP, the BEA has helped economists catch up with the accounting and finance professions. Public companies have long reported the top line (revenue) and the bottom line (profit) at the same time each quarter. For a national economy, GO corresponds to the top line (total activity) and GDP to the bottom line (final product). As the economists Dale Jorgenson, J. Steven Landefeld and William Nordhaus wrote in a 2006 book: “Gross output [GO] is the natural measure of the production sector, while net output [GDP] is appropriate as a measure of welfare. Both are required in a complete system of accounts.”\\nGO also dispels the popular Keynesian myth that consumer spending is the driver of economic growth. For example, the New York Times recently warned: “With personal consumption accounting for nearly 70 percent of all economic activity .\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0the administration will be hard pressed to lift growth substantially if consumers remain cautious about opening their wallets.” But GDP is an incomplete measure of economic activity. It overlooks the value of all goods-in-process, which amounted to more than $14.7 trillion in 2017.\\nThe broader-based GO highlights the reality that business spending is actually substantially larger than consumption. Consumption is 69% of GDP but just 39% of GO, while business spending is 17% of GDP but 52% of GO. This model therefore better recognizes the vital contributions of entrepreneurship, capital investment and innovative technology. As Larry Kudlow, the new director of the National Economic Council, wrote in 2006: “It is business, not consumers, that is the heart of the economy. When businesses produce profitably, they create income-producing jobs and thus consumers spend. Capital formation is the key to worker productivity and consumer prosperity.”\\nThe first-quarter 2018 GO release won’t come until July 20, but BEA director Brian Moyer says the agency plans to release both GO and GDP at the same time within the next year or two. Hopefully by then the media will catch on to this advance in supply-side national accounting and leading indicator of robust economic performance.\\nMr. Skousen is a presidential fellow at Chapman University.

Today we look at what to expect in the first-quarter GDP report, fallout from U.S.-China commercial tension, deregulation amid economic expansion, Angela Merkel\\'s upcoming visit with President Trump, and the languishing startup scene in the U.S.\\nWHY IS THE U.S. ECONOMY SLOWING?\\nThe U.S. economy grew at a 1.8% pace in the first quarter, according to forecasts, a marked slowdown from the 3.1% average of the prior three quarters. Don\\'t worry. It\\'s not out of whack with the first quarter of 2017 (1.2%) or 2016 (0.6%). Since 2007, gross domestic product growth has averaged 0.2% in first quarters and 1.9% in all others. The Commerce Department tries to adjust for seasonal quirks (construction is down in the winter, retail sales jump at Christmas) and is making improvements to its calculations. But economists believe the agency is still missing something. \"If this is indeed the case, then the [Bureau of Economic Analysis\\'s] estimates of first-quarter growth may be underestimating the true strength of the US economy,\" economists at Morgan Stanley said.\\nHERE FOR THE DURATION\\nSo what’s left for investors and observers when the numbers are released Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET?\\xa0 Cleveland Fed research last year found national defense spending makes a large contribution to the seasonally wonky pattern. So skip it. Look for any surprises on\\xa0consumer spending, a key driver of economic growth, trends in business investment, which helps lay the foundation for future growth, and the drag from trade, which is politically sensitive.\\nSide note: The current expansion started in mid-2009. That makes it the third-longest on record. If it stretches into the second half of this year (as expected), it will be the second longest.\\nComments\\xa0or\\xa0\\xa0suggestions\\xa0for Real\\xa0Time\\xa0Economics? Write to\\xa0Jeffrey Sparshott at\\xa0\\xa0realtimeeconomics@wsj.com, tweet to\\xa0@WSJecon\\xa0and visit\\xa0wsj.com/economy\\xa0for the latest.\\nWHAT TO WATCH TODAY\\nThe European Central Bank’s rate decision is out at 7:45 a.m. ET., followed by ECB President Mario Draghi’s press conference at 8:30 a.m. ET. No policy action is expected but\\xa0Mr. Draghi is likely to discuss whether he thinks the risks to the region’s economy have increased.\\nU.S. advance trade in goods for March is out at 8:30 a.m. ET. The figure has become politically important as the Trump administration highlights mounting trade deficits as it makes a series of protectionist moves.\\nU.S. durable goods orders for March are out at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect a 1.8% rise from the prior month. The headline figure is often skewed by airline orders. Look at new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft for hints at underlying business investment trends.\\nU.S. jobless claims, out at 8:30 a.m. ET, are expected to remain historically low.\\nTOP STORIES\\nCHILLING EFFECT\\nSome Chinese businesses\\xa0are\\xa0canceling or slowing plans to invest in the American market\\xa0because of U.S. threats to restrict investment.\\xa0China’s Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng didn’t name any specific businesses, but said that reduced investment from Chinese companies could affect U.S. employment and economic growth. If imposed, the U.S. restrictions would open a new front in an escalating trade battle, Liyan Qi reports. Mr. Gao said said Beijing is prepared to respond if the U.S. goes ahead with its plan. “We are sticking to our bottom-line thinking and are prepared to take action.”\\nSMALL TARGET\\nIn the U.S., some businesses are already feeling the\\xa0effects of the U.S.-China trade spat. Exports from small U.S. businesses to China have nearly tripled in the past 15 years, in line with the broader trend in bilateral trade. China’s latest tariffs target a wide swath of small businesses found among President Donald Trump’s support base in the U.S. Farm Belt, including growers of soybeans, sorghum and live hogs, as well as potentially bigger exporters such as aircraft manufacturers.\\nROOT OF THE PROBLEM\\nHere\\'s one example: Ginseng is a tiny sliver of the trade between the world’s two largest economies, making up about 0.02% of total U.S. exports to China. But effective April 2, the U.S.-grown root was slapped with a 15% tariff that Beijing imposed on U.S. agricultural commodities, part of the tit-for-tat exchange of tariffs that together potentially cover at least $200 billion in goods. That levy threatens to price American ginseng out of Chinese markets altogether, Chuin-Wei Yap reports. That may not seem like a big deal, but it’s potentially devastating to Paul Hsu and other U.S. farmers around Wausau, Wisc. The root has become a mainstay of this flat, fertile region over the past century—and an emblem of how globalization became embedded throughout the U.S. economy. “Nobody wins trade wars,” Mr. Hsu said.\\nPREPARE TO PAY MORE FOR YOUR NEXT TV\\nU.S. consumers also could feel the sting of tariffs. The Trump administration’s proposed tariffs on Chinese imports include a 25% levy on TVs and related components. A report commissioned by two trade associations says the levy could push up television prices in the U.S. by 4% overall, and by 23% for those from China. It isn’t clear whether manufacturers or retailers would shoulder the added costs or pass them along to consumers, Andrew Tangel reports. “The uncertainty level is extraordinarily high,” said Gary Shapiro, chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association. The report, based on trade data and an analysis of demand, suggested U.S. consumers could pare TV purchases by 8%, in terms of dollars spent, if the tariffs lead to higher prices.\\nHOT HOT HOT!\\nDeep into an economic boom with asset prices near records is when you’d expect the U.S. financial system’s guardians to tamp down risk-taking. Instead, federal regulators and legislators are doing the opposite—watering down, narrowing or declining to enforce rules passed after the financial crisis, Greg Ip writes. The changes are modest and don’t foreshadow a crisis any time soon. But the timing is definitely awkward. They will stimulate lending and risk-taking at a time when the industry is lowering its own standards amid a near-record economic expansion. Much as this year’s tax cut may overheat an economy already near full employment, the deregulatory push could aggravate excesses that come back to haunt the economy in its next downturn.\\nMS. MERKEL GOES TO WASHINGTON\\nAfter the razzmatazz of French President Emmanuel Macron’s state visit, Angela Merkel’s meeting with President Trump Friday is likely to be an altogether more businesslike affair, Simon Nixon writes. Whereas the U.S. president has forged an improbable bromance with his French counterpart, his relationship with the German chancellor is more strained. Mr. Trump has in the past been highly critical of Ms. Merkel’s policies. With Mr. Trump yet to decide whether to make the European Union’s current temporary exemption from tariffs on imported metals permanent before it expires on May 1, Ms. Merkel can expect the EU’s allegedly unfair trade practices to be firmly on the agenda.\\nCHARTS OF THE DAY: START ME UP\\nAmerica\\'s startup scene just ain\\'t what it used to be.

The startup slowdown also suggests a loss of dynamism across the broader U.S. economy, with Americans either less willing or less able to launch a new venture, and a decline in the kind of churn that leads to greater opportunity for workers and rising productivity.\\nIn fact, new establishments accounted for more jobs during parts of the recession than they do now.\\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\\n\"A commercial war opposing allies is not consistent with our mission, with our history, with our current commitments for the global security.

Today we look at what to expect in the first-quarter GDP report, fallout from U.S.-China commercial tension, deregulation amid economic expansion, Angela Merkel\\'s upcoming visit with President Trump, and the languishing startup scene in the U.S.\\nWHY IS THE U.S. ECONOMY SLOWING?\\nThe U.S. economy grew at a 1.8% pace in the first quarter, according to forecasts, a marked slowdown from the 3.1% average of the prior three quarters. Don\\'t worry. It\\'s not out of whack with the first quarter of 2017 (1.2%) or 2016 (0.6%). Since 2007, gross domestic product growth has averaged 0.2% in first quarters and 1.9% in all others. The Commerce Department tries to adjust for seasonal quirks (construction is down in the winter, retail sales jump at Christmas) and is making improvements to its calculations. But economists believe the agency is still missing something. \"If this is indeed the case, then the [Bureau of Economic Analysis\\'s] estimates of first-quarter growth may be underestimating the true strength of the US economy,\" economists at Morgan Stanley said.\\nHERE FOR THE DURATION\\nSo what’s left for investors and observers when the numbers are released Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET?\\xa0 Cleveland Fed research last year found national defense spending makes a large contribution to the seasonally wonky pattern. So skip it. Look for any surprises on\\xa0consumer spending, a key driver of economic growth, trends in business investment, which helps lay the foundation for future growth, and the drag from trade, which is politically sensitive.\\nSide note: The current expansion started in mid-2009. That makes it the third-longest on record. If it stretches into the second half of this year (as expected), it will be the second longest.\\nComments\\xa0or\\xa0\\xa0suggestions\\xa0for Real\\xa0Time\\xa0Economics? Write to\\xa0Jeffrey Sparshott at\\xa0\\xa0realtimeeconomics@wsj.com, tweet to\\xa0@WSJecon\\xa0and visit\\xa0wsj.com/economy\\xa0for the latest.\\nWHAT TO WATCH TODAY\\nThe European Central Bank’s rate decision is out at 7:45 a.m. ET., followed by ECB President Mario Draghi’s press conference at 8:30 a.m. ET. No policy action is expected but\\xa0Mr. Draghi is likely to discuss whether he thinks the risks to the region’s economy have increased.\\nU.S. advance trade in goods for March is out at 8:30 a.m. ET. The figure has become politically important as the Trump administration highlights mounting trade deficits as it makes a series of protectionist moves.\\nU.S. durable goods orders for March are out at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect a 1.8% rise from the prior month. The headline figure is often skewed by airline orders. Look at new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft for hints at underlying business investment trends.\\nU.S. jobless claims, out at 8:30 a.m. ET, are expected to remain historically low.\\nTOP STORIES\\nCHILLING EFFECT\\nSome Chinese businesses\\xa0are\\xa0canceling or slowing plans to invest in the American market\\xa0because of U.S. threats to restrict investment.\\xa0China’s Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng didn’t name any specific businesses, but said that reduced investment from Chinese companies could affect U.S. employment and economic growth. If imposed, the U.S. restrictions would open a new front in an escalating trade battle, Liyan Qi reports. Mr. Gao said said Beijing is prepared to respond if the U.S. goes ahead with its plan. “We are sticking to our bottom-line thinking and are prepared to take action.”\\nSMALL TARGET\\nIn the U.S., some businesses are already feeling the\\xa0effects of the U.S.-China trade spat. Exports from small U.S. businesses to China have nearly tripled in the past 15 years, in line with the broader trend in bilateral trade. China’s latest tariffs target a wide swath of small businesses found among President Donald Trump’s support base in the U.S. Farm Belt, including growers of soybeans, sorghum and live hogs, as well as potentially bigger exporters such as aircraft manufacturers.\\nROOT OF THE PROBLEM\\nHere\\'s one example: Ginseng is a tiny sliver of the trade between the world’s two largest economies, making up about 0.02% of total U.S. exports to China. But effective April 2, the U.S.-grown root was slapped with a 15% tariff that Beijing imposed on U.S. agricultural commodities, part of the tit-for-tat exchange of tariffs that together potentially cover at least $200 billion in goods. That levy threatens to price American ginseng out of Chinese markets altogether, Chuin-Wei Yap reports. That may not seem like a big deal, but it’s potentially devastating to Paul Hsu and other U.S. farmers around Wausau, Wisc. The root has become a mainstay of this flat, fertile region over the past century—and an emblem of how globalization became embedded throughout the U.S. economy. “Nobody wins trade wars,” Mr. Hsu said.\\nPREPARE TO PAY MORE FOR YOUR NEXT TV\\nU.S. consumers also could feel the sting of tariffs. The Trump administration’s proposed tariffs on Chinese imports include a 25% levy on TVs and related components. A report commissioned by two trade associations says the levy could push up television prices in the U.S. by 4% overall, and by 23% for those from China. It isn’t clear whether manufacturers or retailers would shoulder the added costs or pass them along to consumers, Andrew Tangel reports. “The uncertainty level is extraordinarily high,” said Gary Shapiro, chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association. The report, based on trade data and an analysis of demand, suggested U.S. consumers could pare TV purchases by 8%, in terms of dollars spent, if the tariffs lead to higher prices.\\nHOT HOT HOT!\\nDeep into an economic boom with asset prices near records is when you’d expect the U.S. financial system’s guardians to tamp down risk-taking. Instead, federal regulators and legislators are doing the opposite—watering down, narrowing or declining to enforce rules passed after the financial crisis, Greg Ip writes. The changes are modest and don’t foreshadow a crisis any time soon. But the timing is definitely awkward. They will stimulate lending and risk-taking at a time when the industry is lowering its own standards amid a near-record economic expansion. Much as this year’s tax cut may overheat an economy already near full employment, the deregulatory push could aggravate excesses that come back to haunt the economy in its next downturn.\\nMS.

Some analysts in recent weeks have cut their full-year growth forecasts to as low as 2%, from 3%.\\nBrazil’s central bank releases April budget figures. Overspending has failed to pump up the economy and has raised concerns ahead of a heated general election in October. As of March, the shortfall stood at 7% of GDP.\\nThe U.S. Commerce Department releases its second estimate of first-quarter economic growth. The initial GDP release showed the economy lost momentum at the beginning of 2018, coming in at a 2.3% annualized rate. Economists are expecting the second estimate to remain at 2.3%.\\nTHURSDAY: China releases the official gauge of factory activity for May (release time is Wednesday night in the U.S.). Economists expect the manufacturing purchasing managers index to hold steady at 51.4 in May. Production likely remained robust, but new orders probably have been disrupted by ongoing trade tensions between China and the U.S., they say.\\nAfter a disappointingly weak start to the year for the eurozone economy, the European Central Bank is expected to finally receive some encouraging news with the release of inflation figures for May. Economists expect to see a rise in the annual rate of inflation to 1.6%, from 1.2% in April, moving the metric closer to the ECB’s target of just under 2%. Rising energy prices are likely to have pushed the rate higher, but a measure of core inflation that excludes that factor is expected to record a more modest increase, to 1% from 0.7% in April.\\nFRIDAY: The U.S. Labor Department publishes the May jobs report. In April, the unemployment ratefell to 3.9%, the lowest level since 2000, as the economy added a weaker-than-expected 164,000 jobs. Economists expect the unemployment rate to stabilize at 3.9% in May, with about 188,000 jobs likely added in the month.\\n'},\n",

Last month the Bureau of Economic Analysis revised its estimate for the first quarter of 2018; the BEA now says gross domestic product grew 2%, annualized, down from the previous figure of 2.2%. This dramatically understates the economy’s actual performance. A better measure, factoring in statistics on incomes, shows growth steaming along at a much stronger 2.8%.\\nWhy the difference? In short, because the data aren’t perfect. Unlike the unemployment rate, which comes from a (relatively) straightforward survey, GDP is not measured directly. Instead, the BEA sums up economy-wide expenditures from dozens of data sources, covering consumption, investment, government spending, net exports and more.\\nLast month’s figure was the BEA’s third estimate for the first quarter. Yet at this stage the statisticians have comprehensive data on only 38.5% of GDP. Most of the rest was inferred using direct or indirect indicators, such as by taking the number of housing starts as a proxy for dollars invested in new home construction. For 12% of GDP, the statisticians used “trend-based data,” which essentially amounts to extrapolation and guess work. To take a couple of specific examples, the BEA had a reasonably accurate measure of cars bought in the first quarter, but it had to guess how much financial services were purchased.\\nProducing the most accurate statistics can be costly, complicated and fraught with these kinds of measurement problems. Despite the best efforts of the BEA’s excellent civil servants, the underlying data are noisy and incomplete, meaning that revisions to GDP growth estimates can be large and often confusing. The average absolute revision from 1993 through 2016 was 1.3 percentage point.\\nDrawing on more data can cancel out some of this noise and produce a more accurate figure that requires smaller revisions. Specifically, the BEA separately gauges the size of the economy by adding up all the different sources of income, such as wages and profits. This figure is called gross domestic income, or GDI, and in the first quarter of 2018 it grew by an estimated 3.6%, annualized.\\nUltimately, GDI should be identical to GDP, since all money spent is money earned. But in practice the published estimates differ because the data are subject to different errors and reflect different guesses. Research shows that a simple average of GDP and GDI is a nearly optimal way to combine the two sets of information. For the first quarter it averages to 2.8% growth. That is the best predictor of what the government will eventually estimate for GDP after several years of revisions.\\nThe BEA’s statisticians already report this number, which they call “average of GDP and GDI,” but they bury it, and the financial press and analysts usually ignore it. The BEA should immediately start reporting this figure as its headline growth estimate, because it is the most accurate way to measure the economy. Until it does, serious analysts can help themselves by playing down the noisier GDP data and focusing on the average, which better captures the economic signal.\\nWith more time and resources, the BEA should integrate data from expenditures and incomes together into a single unified estimate, as many countries, including the United Kingdom and Canada, already do. When the BEA is filling in the blanks for the missing data on financial services, for example, it could choose numbers from both sources to create a combined best guess.\\nThe additional accuracy would be beneficial for businesses and policy makers planning for the future. But accuracy becomes even more important when the economy may be entering a recession. Since estimating GDP involves extrapolating past performance, it overstates growth when things turn sharply downward.

       "  'article_text': 'The economy has often appeared weaker than it is at the beginning of the year because of how the government measures growth. But after years of grumbling from financial heavyweights, officials say they have have solved the problem.\\nFirst-quarter gross domestic product growth from 2012 through 2017 has averaged an annual rate of 2.1%, according to fresh data the Bureau of Economic Analysis released Friday in a periodic revision. That is substantially higher than the previous 1.6% average, which made it the weakest of the four quarters. Changes to seasonal adjustment typically increase growth in some quarters at the expense of others with no impact on the year as a whole. That effect, along with other revisions, resulted in the fourth quarter now clocking the slowest average growth at 1.7%.\\nWhen not seasonally adjusted, economic growth is typically slower in the first three months of a year because of harsher weather and other regular spending patterns. The government attempts to adjust for this to give a better sense of underlying economic activity.\\nBEA had taken multiple steps to address so-called “residual seasonality” in its data that made growth at the start of each year appear misleadingly sluggish.\\nThose initial attempts to fix the issue helped, but data testing by different analysts revealed first-quarter growth still appeared weaker, with multiple components of GDP, including national defense spending, continuing to skew the numbers.\\nAfter the bureau began seasonally adjusting some underlying data that hadn’t previously been touched, along with other tweaks, the seasonality appears to have all but disappeared from GDP data.\\n“Based on what we have done and our tests, we are not showing signs of residual seasonality,” said Erich Strassner, associate director of BEA’s National Economic Accounts division.\\nMr. Strassner acknowledged they would need to continue testing the data to see if the pattern arises again.\\nOther key takeaways:\\nEconomic growth at the end of 2017 was significantly slower than the government originally published. BEA said GDP growth in the third and fourth quarter was 2.8% and 2.3%, respectively, down from the 3.2% and 2.9% originally reported for the two quarters. Overall growth for 2017 was revised down because of weaker consumer spending and exports and stronger imports, the latter of which subtracts from economic growth in the government’s calculation.\\nThe final two quarters of last year were initially a part of a strong three-quarter stretch of growth President Donald Trump’s administration and other economists were touting as the start of a new, robust growth trend in the economy.\\nOver the past decade, average GDP growth was slightly better than previously thought, with growth between 2007 and 2017 averaging 1.5%, above the previous 1.4% average. Investment was higher than data initially suggested, which would have boosted growth in the last decade even more, but the U.S. bought more foreign-made goods, which partially offset the ramped-up investment.\\nThe government revised its investment measure up from 2007 to 2017 because it found companies had made expensive cloud-computing investments, but they were buried deeper in the data, classified in different miscellaneous categories. BEA also reworked how it calculated research and development spending on original production of software.\\nThe economy has experienced a bout of puzzlingly low productivity growth, much to the consternation of economists. Business investment in new machinery and software helps companies increase the efficiency of its operations and employees. Some analysts have argued widespread technology investment isn’t reaching all industries fast enough, which is likely contributing to the slower productivity growth in the U.S. Friday’s revisions could suggest companies were investing more than economists are currently aware of.\\nThe average personal saving rate in the last five years was revised up to 7.0 from 5.0, but it wasn’t entirely because Americans saved more of their paychecks than thought. Sole-proprietor and partnership income from 2012 to 2017 was significantly higher than originally published because of misreporting on income-tax forms. Spending, however, wasn’t revised up along with the increased income, which is why the saving rate moved higher.\\nRELATED\\nU.S. Economy Grew At 4.1% Rate in Second Quarter\\xa0\\nDespite Attempts to Fix the Data, First-Quarter GDP May Still Mislead (April 27, 2018)\\nWhy First-Quarter Growth Is Often Weak (Apr 25, 2017)\\n'},\n",

Today we look at U.S. economic growth, inflation expectations, Trump\\'s tactical shift on trade,\\xa0slower growth in China and France,\\xa0and\\xa0how investors unfriended Facebook .\\nTRUMP PREVIEWS GDP\\nHoping for a sneak peek of Friday morning\\'s GDP numbers? President Donald Trump outlined his expectations for the economic growth report: \"Somebody actually predicted today, 5.3. I don\\'t think that\\'s going to happen; 5.3. If it has a 4 in front of it, we\\'re happy. If it has like a 3, but it\\'s a 3.8, 3.9, 3.7 we\\'re OK.\"\\nSo, high 3s or low 4s? We\\'ll know for sure when the Commerce Department publicly releases its first official estimate of second-quarter gross domestic product at 8:30 a.m. ET. The president is privy to the report the evening before though executive branch officials aren’t supposed to talk about it, Rebecca Ballhaus and Harriet Torry report.\\nBEHIND THE STRONG GROWTH\\nEconomists expect the U.S. economy\\'s output grew at a seasonally and inflation-adjusted annual rate of 4.4% in the second quarter. That would mark one of the strongest quarters in this nine year-old expansion. While consumer spending likely bounced back from a weak first quarter, economists think trade drastically skewed the second-quarter numbers to the upside due to companies stockpiling ahead of expected tariffs and a surge in U.S. soybean exports during the second quarter. That could prove a one-time boost. - Harriet Torry\\xa0\\nDo you think U.S. economic growth is peaking?\\xa0Write to Jeffrey Sparshott at\\xa0realtimeeconomics@wsj.com, tweet to\\xa0@WSJecon\\xa0and visit\\xa0wsj.com/economy\\xa0for the latest news. (Please include your full name and hometown, or a title and company. Responses may be quoted in this newsletter.)\\nWHAT TO WATCH TODAY\\nU.S. gross domestic product for the second quarter, out at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to climb at a 4.4% pace.\\nThe University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index for July, out at 10 a.m. ET, is expected to inch up to 97.3 from 97.1 earlier in the month. U.S. consumers have been broadly upbeat amid strong job creation and economic growth.\\nTOP STORIES\\nSMOOTH OPERATOR\\nFriday’s GDP report has a little something extra: a five-year comprehensive benchmark revision. Commerce Department economists and analysts incorporate more reliable source data and improve their methodology, often resulting in more accurate figures and small adjustments to quarterly numbers. There’s not typically any major shift in our understanding of the economy. One thing to watch this time: changes to the seasonal adjustment process. Commerce acknowledges it has a problem smoothing its data—with proper seasonal adjustment the first quarter should not regularly come in\\xa0much weaker than other quarters. It’s trying to fix that to better reveal underlying economic trends. That could mean upward revisions for first quarters, downward revisions for other quarters, and the big picture just about the same.\\nNOT-SO-GREAT EXPECTATIONS\\nU.S. consumers have been expecting annual inflation of between 2.5% and 3% for most of the past eight years, according to a monthly University of Michigan survey. That held even during 2015, when annual inflation was trending near zero. Now, the consumer-price index is approaching 3%. Is that causing\\xa0households to recalculate? Nope. They\\'re sticking to their guns—expecting 2.9% inflation in the next year, according to a July survey. Well-anchored inflation expectations allowed Federal Reserve policy makers to look beyond temporary factors holding down price increases in the recent past. Will those same expectations give the Fed leeway if inflation overshoots its target? The University of Michigan updates\\xa0its numbers Friday at 10 a.m. ET. - Eric Morath\\nTACTICAL SHIFT ON TRADE\\nThe Trump administration opted for cooperation over confrontation in its latest round with the European Union. But Republicans pushed the administration to find similar solutions on other fronts: Trump advisers got an earful from angry lawmakers on Capitol Hill, who blasted the administration’s approach, criticized the Europe pact as weak, demanded faster relief for ailing constituents and pledged to ramp up efforts to tie Mr. Trump’s hands in shaping trade policy going forward, Siobhan Hughes and Jacob M. Schlesinger report.\\nMr. Trump’s aides said his policy has led to\\xa0newly active negotiations from North America to Asia to Africa. They said that has raised the prospect of new trade gains amid the pain already felt in the U.S. from higher import prices and from exports lost due to retaliation by trading partners.\\nCHINA\\'S SLOWING ECONOMY\\nThe Trump administration sees China as America\\'s\\xa0biggest economic threat. But the Asian nation is having troubles of its own. China is moving faster than expected to inject money into the economy, a sign that the government is becoming more worried about slowing growth as trade tensions are on the rise. The country’s cabinet this week encouraged local governments to quickly tap the bond market. The central bank lent more than 500 billion yuan ($74 billion) to banks, a push to get them to lend and the largest one-time amount since such injections started in 2014. The recent measures are directed at an economy that has seen growth gradually slow for eight years, Chao Deng reports.\\nFRANCE\\'S SLOWING ECONOMY\\nFrance may have won the World Cup. But its economy didn\\'t win the second quarter. GDP grew an anemic 0.2% on a quarterly basis between April and June. That works out to 0.6% annualized growth (which is how the U.S. reports GDP), according to J.P. Morgan . In contrast, the U.S. is expected to post 4.4%. One of the key factors in France: a drop in household consumption driven in part by transit strikes. Trade also subtracted from growth. J.P. Morgan says the French data \"suggests a bit of downside risk\" to eurozone GDP, which is due Tuesday. The bank had called for 2% annualized growth, but now it could come in a bit below that. - Brian Blackstone\\nCHART OF THE DAY: FRIEND REQUEST\\nFacebook suffered the biggest-ever one-day loss in market value for a U.S.-listed company after it warned about slowing growth. Facebook’s loss in market value Thursday is larger than 457 of the 500 companies in the S&P 500.\\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\\nTrade wars encourage predatory state behaviour. They lead to higher taxes, reduce consumer choice and hamper economic freedom, and they are not easy to win. The result is trade controlled by governments, instead of companies and consumers making decisions in their own interests. -\\xa0EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström, writing in The Financial Times\\nTWEET\\xa0OF THE DAY\\nThe journalism exercise of putting large numbers in perspective, @facebook edition: Yesterday\\'s $119B loss in market value exceeds 1) the individual market caps of 91% of S&P 500 companies; 2) the combined cap of the bottom 20 S&P cos; 3) the individual GDPs of Sudan and Ukraine\\n— Ben St. Clair (@BenStClair1) July 27, 2018\\nWHAT ELSE WE\\'RE READING\\nChina appeared caught off guard by President Trump’s aggressive trade tactics. \"Sources and observers told the South China Morning Post that the problem is policies introduced by Beijing–driven by a need to consolidate the party’s power–that have discouraged policy advisers from having in-depth discussions with their US counterparts that would help them to understand the latest thinking in Washington, or from speaking their minds. That has left Beijing without a comprehensive strategy to deal with the Trump administration, at least on the trade front, at a time of heightened tension and rivalry,\" Wendy Wu and Kristin Huang write in the Hong Kong newspaper.\\nThe U.S. is still a magnet for scientific talent. \"[W]e estimate students’ location preferences using a hypothetical choice method: we ask respondents to choose between two postdoc job offers, where one offer is in the U.S. and one is abroad. We find that foreign students have a stronger preference for U.S. locations even after controlling for ability and career preferences. Our results suggest the U.S. is managing to retain talented foreign graduate students for postdoc positions,\" Ina Ganguli and Patrick Gaulé write in a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper.\\n'},\n",

The question for investors is how it will do for the rest of the year.\\nGross domestic product grew at a 4.1% annual rate in the second quarter, up from 2.2% in the first, the Commerce Department said Friday. The reality isn’t quite so good, but even though the economy might not be off to the races, it is growing solidly and set to retain that momentum throughout 2018.\\nGDP reports are always a bit of a mess, with oddities in the data creating distortions. This one was messier than most.\\nThe first issue: the effects of trade skirmishes. The report showed that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed appreciably, adding a bit more than a full percentage point to GDP growth. A big reason is that exporters were racing to get goods off the dock before retaliatory tariffs on a number of U.S. products were imposed. Exports of foods, feeds and beverages—a category that includes the soybeans China placed a 25% tariff on this month—rose at a 110% annual rate. That export surge won’t be there in the third quarter, and the likely result is that trade will be a negative for GDP as a result.\\nOn the other hand, businesses cut their inventories and this lowered GDP. To some extent this might have happened because goods that otherwise would have been stockpiled got put on boats to Europe and China, but it also might reflect a pickup in demand that businesses didn’t anticipate. That could set the stage for inventory restocking in the third quarter, which could boost GDP.\\nStripping out trade and inventory effects, final sales to domestic purchasers grew at a 3.9% annual rate, driven by a 4% increase in consumer spending. But these measures of underlying demand also might be slightly misleading as they reflect a catch-up from the first quarter. Final demand grew by 1.9% and consumer spending grew at an annual rate of just 0.5% in the first quarter, in part due to issues like harsh winter weather.\\nFor now, the best thing to do is to look at the underlying trend in final demand. It is up 2.9% from a year earlier, which is better than the 2.4% this time last year, as well as the 2.3% rate it has averaged since the recession ended in 2009.

       "  'article_text': 'The U.S. will see the second reading of third-quarter economic growth, October new-home sales data and personal-income figures. China will release data on factory activity.\\nThe Commerce Department releases its second estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product. In its original report, the agency estimated GDP—the value of all goods and services produced in the U.S.—rose at a seasonally and inflation-adjusted annual rate of 3.5% from July through September. Strong consumer spending powered economic growth over this period, helping to offset weak business investment and a drop in U.S. exports. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast GDP growth was unrevised at a 3.5% annual rate in the third quarter.\\nThe Commerce Department releases data on new-home sales for October. Purchases of newly built single-family homes—a relatively narrow slice of all U.S. home sales—fell 5.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 553,000 in September. This marked the fourth monthly fall for new-home sales and underscored a weak stretch in the housing sector. Economists surveyed by the Journal forecast new-home sales clocked in at an annual rate of 575,000 in October.\\nThe Commerce Department releases personal-income, consumer spending and inflation figures for October. Personal income, reflecting Americans’ pretax earnings from salaries and investments, edged up 0.2% in September, while consumer spending increased a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in September from the prior month. Core prices, the report showed, were up 2.0% from a year earlier. Economists surveyed by the Journal forecast personal-income grew 0.4% in October; they forecast core PCE prices increased 1.9% from a year earlier.\\nChina releases its official gauge of factory activity for November. Economists expect China’s official purchasing managers index to inch closer to 50, compared with October’s 50.2. Continued softness in the leading indicator points to weakening confidence toward future operations among Chinese manufacturers due to rising uncertainties from a trade spat with the U.S.\\nWrite to Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com\\n'},\n",

      "page_content='U.S. consumer prices ticked higher at the end of 2020, as Americans contended with higher gasoline and food costs along with a rise in coronavirus cases across the country.\\nThe consumer-price index—which measures what consumers pay for everyday items including food, clothing and recreational activities—increased a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in December compared with November, the Labor Department said Wednesday.\\nGasoline prices rose 8.4% over the month, accounting for more than 60% of the overall increase in prices, according to the Labor Department.\\nIn the year ended December, prices were up 1.4%, on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, capping a year that saw muted overall inflation and volatile price swings for some items, amid economic disruptions caused by the pandemic. The consumer-price index’s increase during 2020 was the smallest yearly rise since 2015, the Labor Department said.\\nState and local governments at the end of last year renewed restrictions on businesses and activity in efforts to counter a resurgence in coronavirus cases.\\n“Prices are likely to remain contained in the very near term as demand comes under pressure from virus-combatting protocols,” said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, in a research note.\\nEconomists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal were expecting a 0.4% rise in consumer prices over the month and a 1.3% increase over the year.\\nExcluding the often-volatile categories of food and energy, so-called core prices were up 0.1% in December versus November and rose 1.6% from the year prior, matching economists’ expectations. The yearly increase in core prices has clocked in at 1.6% in each of the past three months.\\nThe overall index on a monthly basis has risen in six of the past seven months. While gains slowed in the fall and into the winter, prices continued a rebound from early on in the pandemic, when they fell as much as 0.8%.\\nAfter falling in November, grocery prices rose 0.4% last month. Prices for apparel increased strongly over the month, as discounting was less prevalent during the 2020 holiday season than in typical years, economists said.\\nPrices for services, excluding energy, were up 0.1% on the month, with a strong rise in costs for motor vehicle insurance. Prices for services such as medical care and transportation fell, however, and service-sector prices broadly have been slower to rebound than goods prices.\\nUsed-vehicle prices fell 1.2% in December, but were up 10%, on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, over the year. Supply chain disruptions contributed to volatile prices for used vehicles last year.\\nEconomists expect the U.S. economic recovery from the pandemic to pick up steam in the second half of this year. In a Journal survey last month, economists on average projected the consumer-price index in June 2021 will be 2.4% higher than the same month in 2020.\\n“Assuming we do see a full reopening in the months ahead, the combination of increased demand in an economy that has seen supply capacity shrink is likely to generate rapid price increases in several components of the inflation basket,” said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, in a research note.\\nFederal Reserve officials have signaled plans to keep interest rates low as the recovery continues, even if inflation reaches their 2% target. Fed officials last March cut their short-term interest rate to near zero as part of efforts to bolster the economy, and have since pledged a higher bar to raise rates.\\nWrite to Amara Omeokwe at amara.omeokwe@wsj.com\\n' metadata={'article_id': 51789, 'date': 20210113, 'folder': 'inflation_rate', 'textfile': 'inflation-rate_2021-1-1_to_2021-7-1.txt'}\n",

      "page_content='U.S. consumer prices rose sharply in March as the economic recovery gained momentum, marking the start of an expected monthslong pickup in inflation pressures.\\nSome of the price increases reflected temporary factors, but others showed how demand for many goods and services is reviving a year after the coronavirus pandemic shut down large swaths of the economy, analysts said.\\nThe Labor Department reported Tuesday that its consumer-price index—which measures what consumers pay for everyday items including groceries, clothing, recreational activities and vehicles—jumped 2.6% in the year ended March, the biggest 12-month increase since August 2018, and rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in March from February.\\nNearly half the monthly increase was due to a 9.1% jump in gasoline prices, which have climbed partly due to production problems following severe winter storms, economists said.\\nThe so-called core CPI, which excludes the often-volatile categories of food and energy, climbed 1.6% over the prior year, and was up 0.3% in March from February.\\nThe CPI increased more sharply in March than in February, when it rose 1.7% on an annual basis and 0.4% from a month earlier. Core CPI in February was up 1.3% over the previous year, and 0.1% versus January.\\n“One of the major things we’re seeing that marks a big change from recent years is that really for the first time in a decade you have a wide range of businesses with pricing power right now,” said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities. “After a year of closures, people are eager to get out and spend, and they have the means to do it,” she said. “We see a real awakening of the service economy in these numbers.”\\nServices prices, excluding energy, rose 0.4% in March from February, the fastest monthly pace since July 2020, as the country’s recovery from the initial Covid-19 impact took off. Prices for hotels, car rentals, airfare and admission to sporting events were all up in March.\\nHave you noticed changes in the prices that you’re paying for goods and services? Has this influenced your spending habits or plans? Use the form at the end of the article to tell us about your experience or join the conversation in the comment section.\\nEconomists widely expect consumer prices to keep climbing in the months ahead after nearly a year of muted overall inflation as the Covid-19 pandemic damped consumer spending. Whether this rise proves transitory is one of the key questions for markets and the U.S. recovery over the next year or so, as the Biden administration, Congress and the Federal Reserve continue to provide financial support for the economy.\\nFed officials expect inflation to rise temporarily this year because of growing demand fueled by increased vaccination rates, decreasing restrictions on businesses, trillions of dollars in federal pandemic-relief programs and ample consumer savings.\\nMore than a third of Americans have now received at least one Covid-19 vaccine shot, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Congress last month approved another $1.9 trillion in fiscal support.\\nEconomists forecast real U.S. gross domestic product will grow at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.1% in the second quarter, according to a recent Wall Street Journal survey, putting the U.S. economy on track for its best performance since the early 1980s.\\nThe annual inflation measurements in coming months will be boosted as well by comparisons with the figures from last year. Prices dropped steeply in 2020 because of collapsing demand for many goods and services—including air travel, hotels and apparel—as the pandemic hit the economy. Many businesses closed and consumers hunkered down at home.\\nGasoline prices, for instance, were up 22% in March compared with a year earlier. Fuel oil prices were 20% higher.\\nThese so-called base effects will boost the 12-month CPI readings further in April and May, and start diminishing in June, said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. “But prices will still be supported by the economy reopening, especially the service sector, which will unleash demand.”\\nMeanwhile, rising production costs are already pushing up prices of many household goods. Kimberly-Clark Corp., the maker of Huggies diapers and Scott paper products, said last week that it will start raising prices on many of its North America consumer products to help defray higher raw-material costs. A number of other consumer-products companies—including Cheerios maker General Mills Inc., Skippy peanut-butter maker Hormel Foods Corp. and pet-snacks maker J.M. Smucker Co.—have indicated similar plans.\\nBeyond consumer items, many producers of industrial goods and components are raising prices too. For example, two big U.S. manufacturers of heating and cooling equipment have announced price increases. Lennox International Inc. said this week it would raise prices by about 6% to 9% starting June 1 for commercial and residential orders.
